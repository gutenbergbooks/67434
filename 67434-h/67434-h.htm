<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> was a golden morning in early summer, and a
thousand birds were warbling on the landscape,
while the balmy wind murmured low and musical
among the leaves, when a young girl, attired in a
rustic dress, might have been seen tripping over the
lea. Her golden tresses, as she walked, floated on
the wind, and the exercise had called even a richer
carnation than usual to her cheek. Her form was
one of rare beauty, and her gait was grace itself.
As she glided on, more like a sylph than a mortal
being, she carolled one of her country’s simple lays;
and what with her liquid tones, her sweet countenance,
and her bewitching motion, she formed a
picture of loveliness such only as a poet could have
imagined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length she approached a ruined wall, half hidden
by one or two overshadowing trees. The enclosure
partially concealed from view the figure of a young
shepherd, who, leaning on his hand, gazed admiringly
on her approaching figure. Unconscious,
however, of the vicinity of an observer, the maiden
tripped on, until she had almost reached the enclosure,
when the shepherd’s dog suddenly sprung
from his master’s side, and barking violently, would
have leaped on the intruder, had not the youth
checked him. The maiden started and turned pale;
but when she perceived the shepherd her cheeks
flushed with crimson, and she stood before the
youth in a beautiful embarrassment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Down, down, Wallace, mon,” said the young
shepherd, “ken ye not Jeanie yet—the flower o’
Ettrick? Ah! Jeanie, Jeanie,” he added—and his
tone and manner at once betrayed the footing on
which he stood with the maiden—“little did ye ken,
when ye were tripping sae gaily o’er the lea, with a
heart as light as a lavrock and a song as sweet as
the waving of the broom at noonday, that one who
lo’es ye sae dearly, was lookin’ at ye frae behind
this tree.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maiden blushed again, and stealing a timid
glance at her lover, her eyes sought the ground. The
shepherd took her hand, which was not withdrawn
from his grasp, and said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ye ken weel, Jeanie dear, what ye were singing,”
and his voice assumed a sudden seriousness as
he spoke, which caused the maiden again to look up,
although the allusion he made to the subject of her
song, had dyed her cheeks with new blushes, “and
I hae come hither this morning, for I ken ye
passed here—to see ye if only for a moment. Ye ken,
Jeanie, that we were to hae been one next Michaelmas,
and that I was to get the Ellsey farm—a canny
croft it is, dearie, and happy, happy would we hae
been there”—the maiden looked inquiringly in his
face at these words, and her lover continued mournfully—“ye
guess the worst, I see, by that look. In
one word, a richer man has outbid me, and so, for
the third time, hae I been disappointed.” And as he
said these words with a husky voice, betokening the
depth of his emotion, the speaker paused, and drew
the back of his hand across his eyes. His affianced
bride showed the true delicacy of her mind in this
juncture. Instead of saying aught to comfort him,
she drew closer to his side, and laying her hand on
his arm, gazed up into his face with a look so full of
sympathy and love, that its mute, yet all-powerful
eloquence, went to the shepherd’s heart. He drew
her tenderly to his bosom, kissed her unresisting
brow, and gazed for some moments in silent rapture
on her face. At length he spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jeanie,” he said, and his voice grew low and
tremulous as he spoke, “can ye hear bad news? I
canna bide here longer,” he added, after a pause,
and with an obvious effort. The maiden started; but
having introduced the subject, her lover proceeded
firmly—“I canna bide here, year after year, as I
hae done for the last twelvemonth, and be put off,
month by month, wi’ promises that are never to be
fulfilled. I will go away and seek my fortune in
other lands. They say money is to be had amaist for
the asking in the Indies, and ye ken we may never
marry while I remain as now, with na roof to lay
my ain head under, to say naething of yours, Jeanie,
which I hold dearer than ten thousand thousand
sic as mine. So I hae engaged to go out to the
Indies, and the ship sails to-morrow. Do not greet,
my flower o’ the brae,” said he, as the maiden burst
into tears, “for ye ken it is only sufferin’ a lighter
evil to put off a greater one. If I stay here we
maun make up our minds never to be one, for not a
farm is to be had for a puir man like me, from
Ettrick to Inverness. In two years, at maist, I will
return,” and his voice brightened with hope, as he
proceeded, “and then, Jeanie dear, naething shall
keep us asunder, and you shall be the richest, and I
hope the happiest bride in all the border.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The manly pathos of his words, his visible attempt
to stifle his feelings, and the grief she felt at the
contemplated absence of her lover, all conjoined to
heighten the emotion of the maiden, and flinging herself
on her lover’s bosom, she wept long and uncontrollably.
Her companion gazed on in silence, with
an almost bursting heart; but he knew that he could
not recede from his promise, and that the hour of
anguish must be endured sooner or later. Then
why not now? At length the sobs of Jeanie grew
less violent and frequent—the first burst of her
emotion was passing away. Gently then did her
lover soothe her feelings, pointing out to her the
advantages to result from his determination, and
cheering her with the assurance, that in two years,
at farthest, he would return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hae no fears, Jeanie, that ye will not prove
true to me, and for the rest we are in God’s gude
hands. Our lives are as safe in his protection awa
on the seas as by our ain ingle-side. And now farewell,
for the present, dearie—I maun do many
things before we sail to-morrow. God bless you!”
and with these words, dashing a tear from his eye,
he tore himself from the maiden, and walked rapidly
across the lea, as if to dissipate his emotion by the
swiftness of his pace. When he reached the brow
of the hill, however, he turned to take a last look at
the spot where he had parted with Jeanie. She was
still standing where he left her, looking after his
receding form. He waved his hand, gazed a moment
on her, and then whistled to his dog, and dashed
over the brow of the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Jeanie had watched him with tearful eyes
until he paused at the top of the hill, and her heart
beat quick when she saw him turn for a last look.
She made an effort to wave her hand in reply; and
when she saw him disappear beyond the hill, sank
against the wall. Directly a flood of tears came
to her relief. It was hours before she was sufficiently
composed to return home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All through that day, and until late at night,
Jeanie comforted herself with the hope of again
beholding her lover; but he came not. Long after
nightfall, a ragged urchin from the village put into
her hands a letter. She broke it open tremblingly,
for she knew the hand-writing at a glance. It was
from her lover. It was kindly written, and the hand
had been tremulous that penned it; but it told her
that he had felt himself unequal to another parting
scene. Before she received this—it continued—he
would be far on his way to the place of embarkation.
It contained many a sweet message that filled
the heart of Jeanie with sunshine, even while the
tears fell thick and fast on the paper. It bid her
remember him to her only surviving parent, and then
it contained a few more words of hope, and ended
with “God bless you!—think often in your prayers
of Willie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That night Jeanie’s pillow was wet with tears,
but, even amid her sobs, her prayers might have
been heard ascending for her absent lover.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The family of Jeanie was poor but virtuous, like
thousands of others scattered all over the hills and
vales of Scotland. Her father had once seen better
days, having been indeed a farmer in a small way;
but his crops failing, and his stock dying by disease,
he had been reduced at length to extreme poverty.
Yet he bore his misfortunes without repining. He
had still his daughter to comfort him, and though he
lived in a mud-built cottage, he was happy—happy
at least, so far as one in his dependent condition
could be; for his principal support was derived from
the labor of his daughter, added to what little he
managed to earn by doing small jobs occasionally
for his neighbors. Yet he was universally respected.
If you could have seen him on a sunny Sabbath
morning, leaning on his daughter’s arm, walking to
the humble village kirk: if you could have beheld the
respect with which his juniors lifted their bonnets to
him, while his own gray locks waved on the wind as
he returned their salutations, you would have felt
that even utter poverty, if respectable, and cheered
by a daughter’s love, was not without its joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The love betwixt Jeanie and the young shepherd
was not one of a day. It had already been of years
standing, and dated far back, almost into the childhood
of each. By sunny braes, in green meadows,
alongside of whimplin brooks, they had been
used to meet, seemingly by chance, until such meetings
grew necessary to their very existence, and
their love—pure and holy as that between the
angelic choristers—became intermixed with all their
thoughts and feelings, and colored all their views of
life. And all this time Jeanie was growing more
beautiful daily, until she became the flower of the
valley. Her voice was like that of the cushat in its
sweetest cadence—her eye was as blue and sunny
as the summer ether—and the smiles that wreathed
her mouth came and went like the northern lights on
a clear December eve. Thus beautiful, she had not
been without many suitors; but to all she turned a
deaf ear. Many of them were far above her station
in life, but this altered not her determination. Nor
did her father, though perhaps, like many of his
neighbors, he attached more importance to such
offers than Jeanie, attempt to influence her. He only
stipulated that her lover should obtain a farm before
his marriage. We have seen how his repeated
failures in this, and his hopelessness of attaining his
object, unless at a very distant period, had at length
driven him to seek his fortune elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are telling no romantic tale, but one of real
life; and in real life years often seem as hours, and
hours as years. We shall make no excuse, therefore,
for passing over an interval of more than two years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the gloamin hour when Jeanie and her
father sat at their humble threshold. The face of the
maiden was sad almost to tears; while that of the
father wore a sad and anxious expression. They had
been convening, and now the old man resumed their
discourse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, Jeanie,” he said, “God knows I would
na urge ye do that which is wrong; but we hae suffered
and suffered much sin’ Willie left us. Twa
years and a half, amaist a third, hae past sin’ that
day. Do not greet, my dochter, an’ your auld father
may na speak that which is heavy on his mind,” and
he ceased, and folded the now weeping girl tenderly
to his bosom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no, father, go on,” sobbed Jeanie, endeavoring
to compose herself, an effort in which she finally
succeeded. Her father resumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am growing auld, Jeanie, aulder and aulder
every day; my shadow already fills up half my grave—and
the time canna be far awa, when I shall be
called to leave you alone in the warld.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! say not so,” sobbed Jeanie, “you will yet
live many a year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Na, na,” he answered, shaking his head, “though
it pains my heart to say so, yet it is best you
should know the truth. It will na be long before
the snows shall lie aboon me. But I see it makes
you greet. I will pass on, Jeanie, to what lies heavy
on my heart, and that is, when I am awa, there will
be no one to protect you. Could I hae seen ye comfortably
settled, wi’ some one to shield ye from the
cauld world, I could hae gone to my grave in peace.
But it maun na be, it maun na be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Jeanie had listened to her father’s words
with emotions we will not attempt to pourtray.
Long after every one else had given over her lover
for lost—and besides a rumor, now of two years
standing, that he had been drowned at sea, there
was the fact of his not returning at the appointed
time, to silence all skepticism—she had clung to the
hope of his being alive, even when her reason forbid
the expression of that hope. She had long read her
father’s thoughts, nor could she indeed blame them.
Their poverty was daily growing more extreme, so
that while her parent’s health was declining, he was
compelled to deny himself even the few comforts
which he had hitherto possessed. These things
cut Jeanie to the heart, and yet she saw no remedy
for them, except in what seemed to her more terrible
than death. Her affection for her lover was only
strengthened and purified by his loss. Try as she
would, she could not tear his image from her heart.
Loving him thus, living or dead, how could she wed
another?—how could she take on herself vows her
heart refused to fulfil? Day after day, week after
week, and month after month, had this struggle been
going on in her bosom, betwixt duty to her father
and love for him to whom she had plighted her virgin
vows. This evening her parent had spoken to her,
mildly but seriously on the death of her lover, and
Jeanie’s heart was more than ever melted by the
self-devotedness with which her gray-haired father
had alluded to her want of protection in case of his
death, not even saying a word of the want of the
common comforts of life which his growing infirmities
rendered more necessary than ever, but of which
her conduct—oh! how selfish in that moment it
seemed to her—deprived him. It was some moments
before Jeanie could speak, during which time
she lay weeping on her parent’s bosom. At length
she murmured,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do wi’ me as ye wish, father, I maun resist no
longer, sin’ it were wicked. But oh! gie me a little
while to prepare, for the heart is rebellious and hard
to overcome. I know you do it all for the best—but
I maun hae some delay to tear the last thoughts o’
Willie, thoughts which soon wi’ be sinfu’, from my
heart”—and overcome by the intensity of her emotions
she burst into a new flood of tears. Her
father pressed her to his bosom, and murmured,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Jeanie, Jeanie, could ye know how this
pains my auld heart! But the thought that when I
die ye will be left unprotected in the world, is sair
within me. Time ye shall hae, darlint—perhaps,”
he added after a moment’s pause, “it were better to
gie up the scheme altogether. Aye! Jeanie, I will
na cross your wishes even in this; but trust in a gude
God to protect you when I am gone. Say no more,
say no more about it, dear one; but do just as ye
will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, father,” said Jeanie, looking firmly up,
while the tears shone through her long eye-lashes
like dew on the morning grass, “no, I will be selfish
no longer. Your wish shall be fulfilled. Do not
oppose me, for indeed, indeed, I act now as I feel
right. Gie me only the little delay for which I ask,
and then I will do as you say, and—and”—and her
voice trembled as she spoke—“then you will no
longer be without those little comforts, dear father,
which not even all my love has been able to procure
for you. Now kiss me, for I maun go in to be by
myself for awhile.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God bless you, my dochter, and may <span class='it'>he</span> ever
hae you in his keeping,” murmured that gray-haired
sire, laying his hands on his child’s head—his dim
eyes suffusing with tears as he spoke, “God bless
ye forever and ever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When that father and daughter rejoined each
other, an hour later in the evening, a holy calm pervaded
the countenance of each; and the looks which
they gave each other were full of confidence, gratitude
and overflowing affection. And when the
daughter drew forth the old worn Bible, and read a
chapter in her silvery voice, while the father followed
in a prayer that was at times choked by his
emotion, there was not, in all broad Scotland, a
sweeter or more soul-subduing sight than that lowly
cot presented.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Although Jeanie was a girl of strong mind, the
sacrifice which she contemplated was not to be
effected without many inward struggles. But having
made up her mind to what she considered her duty,
she allowed no personal feelings to swerve her from
the strict line she had laid down for herself wherein
to walk. Daily did she seek in prayer for aid; and
never did she allow her parent to hear a murmur
from her lips. Yet, let her strive as she would, the
memory of her lover would constantly recur to her
mind. At the gloamin hour, in the still watches of
the night—by the ingle-side, abroad in the fields,
or in the kirk of God—on Sabbath or week day—when
listening to her aged sire’s voice, or sitting all
alone in her little chamber, the image of him she had
loved would rise up before her, diffusing a gentle
melancholy over her heart, and seeming, for the moment,
to raise an impassable barrier betwixt her and
the fulfilment of her new vows—for those vows had
already been taken, and the evening which was to
make her another’s, was only postponed until the
intended bridegroom—a staid farmer of the border—could
make the necessary preparations in his
homestead, necessary to fit it for a new mistress, and
she the sweetest flower of the district.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are telling no romantic tale, drawn from the
extravagant fancy of a novelist, but a sober reality.
There are hundreds, all over this broad realm, who
are even now sacrificing themselves like Jeanie.
Aye! in many a lowly cottage, unrecked of and
uncared for by the world, wither away in secret
sorrow, beings who, had their lot been cast in happier
places, would have been the brightest and most joyous
of creatures. How many has want driven, unwilling
brides, to the nuptial altar! Who can tell the
sacrifice woman will not make to affection, although
that sacrifice may tear her heart’s fibres asunder?
And thus Jeanie acted. Although she received
the attentions of her future husband with a smile,
there was a strange unnatural meaning in its cold
moonlight expression. Even while he talked to her,
her thoughts would wander away, and she would
only be awakened from her reverie by some sudden
ejaculation of his at perceiving her want of attention.
He knew her history, but he had been one of her
earliest lovers, and he flattered himself that she had
long since forgotten the absent; and, although at
times her demeanor would, for a moment, make him
suspect the truth, yet a conviction so little in unison
with his wishes, led him instantly to discard it. And
Jeanie, meanwhile, continued struggling with her
old attachment, until her health began to give way
beneath the conflict. She scarcely seemed to decline—at
least to eyes that saw her daily—but yet
her neighbors marked the change. In the beautiful
words of the ballad,</p>

<p class='line0'>And she drooped like a lily broke down by the hail.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>The morning of her wedding-day saw her as beautiful
as ever, but with how touching, how sweet
an expression of countenance! As she proceeded to
the kirk, her exquisite loveliness attracted every eye,
and her air of chastened sadness drew tears from
more than one spectator acquainted with her history.
The bridegroom stood smiling to receive his lovely
prize, the minister had already begun the service,
and Jeanie’s heart beat faster and faster as the moment
approached which was forever after to make
all thoughts of Willie sinful, when suddenly the rattling
of rapid wheels was heard without, and instantaneously
a chaise stopped at the kirk door, and a
tall form leaping from the vehicle strode rapidly up
the aisle at the very moment that the minister asked
the solemn question, if any one knew aught why the
ceremony should not be finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ay,” answered the voice of the intruder, and, as
he spoke, he threw off the military cloak he wore
and disclosed to the astonished eyes of the spectators
the features—scarred and sun burnt, but still the
features—of the absent shepherd, “Ay! I stand
here, by God’s good aid, to claim the maiden by right
of a prior betrothal. I am William Sandford.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had a thunderbolt fallen from heaven, or a spirit
risen from the dead, the audience would not have
been more astonished than by this <span class='it'>dénouement</span>. All
eagerly crowded around the intruder, gazing on his
face, as the Jews of old looked on the risen Lazarus.
Doubt, wonder, conviction, enthusiasm followed each
other in quick succession through the minds of the
spectators. But the long absent lover, pushing aside
the friends who thronged around him, strode up to
Jeanie’s side, and, clasping her in his arms, asked,
in a voice no longer firm, but husky with emotion,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! Jeanie, Jeanie, hae ye too forgotten me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The bride had fainted on his bosom; but a score
of eager tongues answered for her, and in hurried
words told him the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What have we more to say? Nothing—except
that the returned lover took the place of the bridegroom,
who was fain to resign his claim, and that
the minister united the now re-animated Jeanie and
her long-remembered lover, while the congregation
looked on with tears of joy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The returned Shepherd—for we shall still call
him so—at length found time to tell his tale. He
had been shipwrecked as rumoured, but, instead of
being drowned, had escaped and reached India.
There he entered the service and was sent into the
interior, where he rose rapidly in rank, but was
unavoidably detained beyond the appointed two years,
while the communications with Calcutta being difficult
and uncertain, the letters written home apprizing
Jeanie of these facts had miscarried. At length, he
had succeeded in resigning his commission, full of
honors and wealth. He hastened to Scotland. He
reached Jeanie’s home, learned that she was even
then becoming the bride of another, hurried wildly
to the church, and—our readers know the rest.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A STORY IN CAMP.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY OLIVER OLDFELLOW.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>The</span> fact is, Jeremy, I never liked the idea of
writing love stories in the presence of a pretty girl,
as there is always something contagious in love,—and
do what I might—I have been a hard student
that way—some how or other I was always apt to
leave off writing, and go to the business of love-making
in downright earnest,—studying from nature, you
see. It somehow puts a fellow’s hand out for writing,
and inclines him more to the use of his tongue,
except when, by way of variation, he cooly slips his
arm around the dear, blushing, unwilling creature,
and drawing her gently to his bosom, as a mother
would her child, smothers the ‘bliss of talking,’ as
Miss Landon called it, by a cousinly introduction of
lips. But,—by the prettiest houri that ever made
Mussulman’s heaven!—how do you think the thing
is to be managed with <span class='it'>two</span> of the prettiest Scotch
lassies that ever inspired the song of a Burns, or the
valor of a Wallace, looking you right in the eye, and
one of them with the most inviting lips, too, that ever
set lover’s heart on fire, and each with a pair of eyes
that would send the blood tingling through the veins
of the veriest woman hater that ever breathed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None of your nonsense, Oliver, but for once give
over the lore of talking of yourself, and let us have
the story within three pages, if you expect to be out
before Christmas with the Magazine! There are a
host of better looking fellows than yourself have had
their eyes upon the girls, and—to tell you the honest
truth,—the game is above your reach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By my faith in woman! Jeremy, you are as sharp
this morning as a nor’-wester—I expect you have
had your <span class='it'>comb cut</span> with one of them. Talking of cutting
combs, reminds me of a story. When I was in
the army!—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha! ha! ha! When you were in the army! By
George! I like that part of the story amazingly—if
the rest is only as good I may feel inclined to allow
you half a page more!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, Jerry, none of that; I’ve known fellows
talk about the army who never even heard a gun,
and chaps spin out most eternal sea-yarns, that never
smelt salt water, as any old tar would tell you before
he had listened five minutes to the story; but I am none
of your green-horns—I know what I am about when
I mention war or beauty,—having seen some service
in my day. I therefore commence properly—as
every story should have a beginning, even if it has
no end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When I was in the army, you see, I became acquainted
with a very sentimental fellow, about your
size,—though he <span class='it'>had</span> rather a better looking whisker
for a soldier,—who was always full of romance, and
all that sort of thing,—and I <span class='it'>do</span> believe the chap had
an idea or two of the right kind in his head, but they
were so mixed up with the wrong kind, that, like the
funds of a good many bankers now-a-days, they were
not always ‘available.’ He had got it into his cranium,
and there it would stick, that he had a little
better blood in him than any body else, so that he
was confoundedly careful not to have any of it spilt,
and nothing but the daughter of a lord came any
way near the mark to which he aspired. He used
to tell a good many stories about himself, and he
would tell them pretty well too, but they somehow
or other had a smack of the marvellous. His stories
about the doings among the gentry—the fellow, you
see, had been educated by a lord, or something of
that sort, and had seen a little of high life above stairs
as well as below—took amazingly in the camp,
especially his sentimental ones, for he had the knack
of making a fool of himself—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, for goodness sake, Oliver! the story!—the
story!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The fact is, Jerry, I am pretty much in the predicament
of the knife-grinder!—Story of my own—I
have none to tell. But here is one of——confound
the fellow’s name,—no matter.”</p>

<hr class='tbk109'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Emily Melville—the only daughter of the proud
Lord Melville, who was well known in the time of
the wars—as the representative of the long line of
illustrious Scottish nobles of that name, was the pride
of the Lowland nobility, and the belle of every assembly.
She was as fair as a white fawn, and scarcely
less wild. Her mother being dead, few restraints
were placed upon the young beauty by the old
house-keeper, who, in the main, filled the place.
Emily, therefore, held in proud disdain the restraints
which would have been imposed by the prudes of
her sex, and thought that the great art of living
was to be happy. Laughter was always on her lips,
and sunlight forever on her brow. She was beautiful,
and you knew it, yet you could not tell the
secret of it, nor, for their restlessness and brilliancy,
whether her eyes were blue or gray, yet you knew
that they were pretty, and felt that they were bright.
Her voice was like the warble of a bird in spring,
its notes were so full of joyousness; and her motion
was like that of a fairy, so light and graceful, that,
had you seen her tripping over the smoothly shaved
lawn in front of the mansion—her auburn hair
drooping in long ringlets over her snowy and finely
rounded shoulders—and heard her gay glad voice,
swelling out in song and happiness, you would have
fancied her an angel from the upper sphere.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I doubt that last part, my good fellow”—interrupted
a bluff old soldier—“until I had tried an arm
around her, to see if she wasn’t flesh and blood, I
wouldn’t a’ trusted fancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“An interruption, gentlemen. You see if the story
is told right, a man must <span class='it'>feel</span> what he says, and you’ll
find out before it’s done, that I”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What, young man! You didn’t begin to make
love to <span class='it'>her</span> did you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gentlemen, I must persist”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, was <span class='it'>she</span> in love—tell us that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Love!—She laughed at it—and said, ‘she loved
nothing but her pet fawn—her canary—the flowers,
both wild and tame—the blue sky—the sunshine—the
heather—the forest—the mountains—and it
might be—she did not know—she <span class='it'>might</span> love her
cousin Harry Hardwick, if he was as pleasant as he
was when her playmate a few years ago—but he
was now at his father’s castle on the mountain, and
perhaps had grown coarse, boorish, or ill-mannered.
She did not know therefore whether she should love
him or not—rather thought she should not—but
then she had her father, and enough around her to
love and cherish, and why should she trouble herself
about the matter.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not wonder, gentlemen, that such a creature
should inspire me with love—a deep, devoted,
heart-absorbing, deathless passion. I loved her as
man never loved woman before. Every pulsation,
every energy of my being seemed for her”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, <span class='it'>you’d</span> love her!—never heard you
tell of a pretty girl that you didn’t love—but give us
the pith and marrow of the matter; did she return
the compliment?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All in good time!—You see the thing might have
been very handsomely managed, if it had not been
for one or two impediments”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What in the plague does the fellow mean by
<span class='it'>impediment</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush, can’t you! He means he didn’t get her,
of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you see, gentlemen, there was a shocking
looking young fellow of a lord, who lived upon the
next estate, who got it into his head that he must
take a hand in the game. To give him his due, he
was accomplished, witty, had a title, and a splendid
whisker, and from beginning to call every few days
to inquire after Lord Melville’s health—the old chap
had the best health in the world—about three times
a-week, he soon managed to call the other four days
on his own account, so that I found the prize in a fair
way to be snatched from my grasp, and I resolved to
bring matters to a close pretty soon. So one morning,
when Lord Melville was out looking into parliamentary
matters, inquiring into the affairs of the
nations, or his own, I thought I would open the
question genteely. Emily had sung for me most
sweetly, without any apology or affectation, and we
were now sitting chatting very pleasantly together.
How easy, then, to turn the conversation in the proper
channel. To discourse of green fields—of murmuring
brooks—of the delights of solitude with one
of congenial tastes—of the birds, the fawn, and the
attachment they showed their mistress. Then, of
course, she would wonder whether they really loved
her, whether they knew what love was, or only felt
joy at her presence, because they knew her as their
feeder. Then I would say, of <span class='it'>course</span> they loved her,
how could they do otherwise,—were not all things
that approached her <span class='it'>fated</span> to love her. Then she
blushes, gets up, and goes to the window opening on
the garden—to look at the flowers maybe—I must
see them too, of course, for they are <span class='it'>her</span> flowers.
I always loved flowers, and particularly love these.
Things, gentlemen, were thus progressing pretty
smoothly, you will see, considering that the lady was
the daughter of a lord, and of course heiress to his
whole estate, when lo!—my unlucky genius as
usual—the housekeeper must poke in her head, and
ask if ‘anybody called.’ No! certainly not! What
young lady ever called a housekeeper at such a time!
Pshaw! The thing was shocking to think of! How
stupid in her! The old thing had an eye in her head
like a hawk, however, and saw pretty clearly how
matters stood, and whether she thought that there
was no chance for me in that quarter, or had some
private preference of her own, she maintained her
ground until I deemed it prudent to withdraw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Days passed away, and no opportunity was
afforded me of renewing my suit. Whether the old
housekeeper took the matter in hand or not, of course
I cannot say; but when days began to grow into
weeks, I began to feel the wretchedness of first love.
Who has not felt its fears, its doubts, the torture,
whether you are beloved by the object of your affection,
and the uncertainty, even in your own mind,
whether you are worthy of that love?—who has not
felt the dread of rivalry, the fears of the effects of a
moment’s absence, and the thousand untold pangs,
which none but a lover’s imagination can inflict—and
he a lover for the first time? It is strange, gentlemen,
that I should, after this sweet interview, which
seemed destined to be the last that I should have with
the most angelic of beings, place myself upon the rack,
and delight in the torture, with the devotion to wretchedness
of a heart inspired with ‘the gentle madness,’
for the first time, of passionate, deathless love—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hold up, comrade! and do give us the pith of the
matter, without all this flummery. I’ve known chaps
talk all day in that strain, who never had any story to
tell, but would go on yarning it until roll-call, just to
hear themselves talk. Now, if you got the gal, say
so—if you didn’t, tell us why—and none of your rigmarole.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, gentlemen, I did not get her, and that
is the reason I am here to tell the story. Misfortunes,
you know, travel close upon each other’s heels, and
sure enough, in the midst of my misery, the carriage
of Lord Hardwick was announced, and who should
it contain but Emily’s cousin ‘Harry,’—her old playmate,
and his sister. I heard the announcement, but
I heard no more, until an hour or two afterwards,
when, out of sheer melancholy, I had taken to the
garden for contemplation and meditation, I <span class='it'>accidentally</span>
overheard Harry Hardwick’s declaration and
his acceptance, and, after half an hour of silence, a
laugh by both parties at my expense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had enough of the soldier’s blood in me, gentlemen,
even then, to <span class='it'>take no notice</span> of this downright incivility
and want of breeding, though I do not of
course suppose that the parties dreamed that they had
a listener, so I cast her off as unworthy of my love;
and thus ended my first love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very sensibly done, too, my boy! I applaud your
spirit. It was worthy of a soldier.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, gentlemen, this was but the opening of difficulties,
for I was no sooner out of this scrape than
my sensitive heart must betray me into another.
How all the dreams of even Emily’s beauty melted
away as the mist from the hills—perhaps assisted
by the knowledge she was the prize of another—when
next morning my eyes beheld Arabella Hardwick.
She was leaning over the back of the sofa, at the
very window from which the day before I had praised
the flowers with Emily. Passing beautiful was she
as she stood in her virgin loveliness before me, with
her highland-cap and its white plume over curls of
jet, that seemed in mere wantonness to fall from
beneath, over her fine neck and swelling bosom,
whose treasures were scarcely concealed by the
highland-mantle which so well became her. Her
brow was slightly shaded with curls, while from beneath,
her eyes, darker than heaven’s own blue,
seemed to be melting before your gaze. Her smile
was sweetness itself, and came from lips of which
heaven and earth seemed to dispute ownership.
Emily was seated at her side, in the act of fixing a
hawk’s feather in a highland-cap for her own fair
brow, yet in her eye mischief and cunning strove for
mastery, and her whole face was so full of meaning
that I knew that I must have been the subject of previous
conversation, and I felt my face crimson before
the highland beauties. I verily believe that I made
an impression, gentlemen, which, had it been properly
followed up, might have been the making of
me; I have always fancied somehow or other that
the highland beauty was rather smitten with me, for
there was such a coaxing expression in her whole
face, and particularly in her lips—which seemed to
be begging a kiss—that I do believe that if it had not
been for the presence of my old flame, ‘my first love,’
gentlemen, I should have carried the fortress by
storm! but you see, as it was, I stood blushing and
looking simple until, for very amusement sake, both
commenced laughing, and Emily broke the ice by
asking me if I had lost my tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“ ‘On this hint I spoke.’—It is not necessary, gentlemen,
to repeat all the fine things I said—for fine
things in a sentimental way, are not relished in
camp—but suffice it to say that the ground was
so well marked out in my first interview, that I
deemed it expedient to pop the question, ‘striking
while the iron’s hot,’ you know—somewhat musty,
but very expressive—yet you will scarcely believe
me, gentlemen—she rejected me <span class='it'>flat</span>—‘<span class='it'>because I
had no whiskers</span>.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t say that was the <span class='it'>main</span> objection?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say that was the only objection, and to prove
its validity, she married five months after, Lord
Gordon, Emily’s former suitor—whose only advantage
was a fine pair of whiskers—with the addition
of an estate and a title.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But perhaps the latter had some weight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None, I assure you, as I pressed the matter,
and she averred, that love in a cottage with a whisker,
was in every way more congenial to her taste,
than the finest mansion in the land without that
appendage. So you see I took to cultivating whiskers
with great assiduity; but for a long time, the
rascals defied all attempts to train them; the shoots
were tolerably advanced in less than six months;
but they were too late—for the lady was married.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you are a cool sort of a fellow to talk of
transferring your love from one high-born lady to
another, with the same ease as a soldier does a
feather from his cap. I suppose you finally courted
the old housekeeper out of sheer revenge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None of that, I assure you, for she revenged my
want of attention that way, by giving Lord Melville
a history of the whole matter—with trimmings.—So
the old codger said I was as crazy as a bed-bug,
and clapped me in the army, as a kind of lunatic
asylum to recover my wits. So that’s the <span class='it'>end of
the story</span>.”</p>

<hr class='tbk110'/>

<p class='pindent'>“There, Jerry, put that in your pipe, or your Magazine,
just as you like, for no story do I write for a
fellow who comes to me with a piece of tape to
measure the length, as if a man spun like a spider,
and if it don’t fill your three pages—add a paragraph
about the children.—What do ye say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s rather so-soish at best, Oliver!—But what
regiment did you say you were in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Regiment—did I say anything about regiment?
You must be mistaken, Jerry! these confounded
soldier terms are all mouldering in my brain, these
peaceable times.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, where was the army encamped?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At a—a place with a confounded French
name—I never had any command of the cursed
language, and was glad enough when we got out of
the place, never to bother my brain with its name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the war!—In what war was it?—Let us
have something to go upon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As for dates and names, Jerry, I never for the
soul of me, could make any headway with them. A
phrenologist once told me, that for names and dates
I had no development, and whenever I begin to try
to think of my exploits in battle, I think the fellow
was right—as I am always out for the want of
names and dates. So I think it best first to tell the
<span class='it'>facts</span>, and let people fix dates to suit themselves. So,
Jerry, hand over the port—this is confounded dry
business.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To tell you the truth, Oliver, the whole story has
rather a squint, and I have half a notion that for
the most of it, we are indebted to the good looks of
the two bonnie Scotch lassies, and rather a marvellous
imagination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> is almost twilight. How swiftly have the moments
glided by since we sat ourselves by this window—let
us see—some two hours since, and during
all that time not a word have we spoken, although
our soul has been gushing over with its exceeding
fulness. It is snowing. Look out and you will see
the downy flakes—there, there, and there—one
chasing another, millions on millions falling without
intermission, coming down noiselessly and mysteriously,
as a dream of childhood, on the earth, and
covering field, and forest, and house-top, hill and
vale, river, glade, and meadow, with a robe that is
whiter than an angel’s mantle. How ceaseless the
descent! What countless myriads—more countless
than even the stars of heaven—have fallen since we
have been watching here! God only could have
ordered the falling of that flake which has just now
sunk to the earth like an infant on its young mother’s
milk-white bosom. Did you not see it? There—follow
this one which has just emerged from the
skies—but at what spot even we cannot detect—see
its slow, easy, tremulous motion as it floats downwards;
now how rapidly it intermingles with the
others, so that you can scarcely keep it in your eye;
and there! there! it shoots to the ground with a
joyous leap—and, even as we speak, another and
another, aye! ten thousand thousand of them have
flitted past, like the gleaming of cherubic wings, such
as we used to see in our childhood’s dreams, glancing
to and fro before a throne of surpassing glory, far,
far away, high up in the skies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is snowing. Faster, faster, faster come down
the feathery flakes. See how they disport themselves—giddy
young creatures as they are—whirling
around; now up, and now down; dancing, leaping,
flying; you can almost hear their sportive laughter
as they skim away across the landscape. Almost,
we say, for in truth there is not a sound to be heard
in earth, air, or sky. The ground, all robed in white,
is hushed in silence—the river sweeps its current
along no longer with a hoarse chafing sound, but
flows onward with a dull, clogged, almost noiseless
motion—not a bird whistles in the wood, nor a beast
lows from the barn-yard—while the trees, lifting
their bleached branches to the skies, shiver in the
keen air, and cower uncomplainingly beneath the
falling flakes. But hark! there is a voice beside us—’tis
that of the beloved of our soul—repeating
Thomson’s Winter—Thomson! majestic at all times,
but oh! how much more so when gushing in silver
music from the lips of the white-armed one beside
us. Hear her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But let us away to the mountains! Far up in a
gorge of the Alleghanies we will stand, with the
clouds whirling wildly around and beneath, and the
wind whistling shrilly far down in some ravine,
which we may not see; for all around us is, as it
were, a shoreless ocean, buried in a ghastly mist,
from which the tall cliffs jut up like islands—and
ever, ever comes to our ears from this boiling vortex
a sound as of many waves chafing against the shore,
like that which the priest of Apollo listened to as he
walked all disconsolate, bereft of his fair-haired
daughter, back from the tents of the stern Hellenes to
the towers of Ilium. The air is full of snow-flakes,
driving hither and thither—thick, thick, thicker
they descend—you cannot see a fathom before you.
Take care how you tread, for a false step may plunge
you into an abyss a thousand feet plumb down. Not
far from here is the very spot where an unwary traveller,
on a night like this, but a bare twelve-month
since, slipped from the edge of the precipice, and was
never heard of again, until the warm sunny breath
of April, melting the snows from beneath the shadows
of the hills, disclosed him lying unburied, with
his face turned up, as if in mockery, to the bright
heavens on which his eye might never look again.
In vain had loved ones watched for his coming until
their eyes grew weary, and their hearts turned to
fountains of tears within them—in vain had a wife
or mother kindled the cheery fire, or smoothed for
him the bed of down, to welcome him after his absence—for</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are in the mountains, in the midst of a snow-storm,
and, as we look around, we feel that Jehovah,
as when Moses heard the noise of a mighty wind, is
passing by. There is a vague emotion of mingled wonder,
fear and awe, overshadowing our soul as we
stand here alone in the tempest. See how the drift
is spinning in the whirlwind; and now it streams out
like a pennant on the night. Hark! to the deep organ
peal of the hurricane as it thunders among the
peaks high up above us—listen to the wild shrieks
rising, we know not whither, as if the spirits of the
mountain were writhing on beds of torture, as the
olden legends say, all unpardoned by their Creator.
And now—louder and wilder than the rest—sounding
upwards from the gulf below, a voice of agony
and might—sublime even in its tribulation, awful in
its expression of gigantic suffering—like that of him
whom the seer of the Apocalypse beheld bound hand
and foot and cast into the bottomless pit, despite an
unyielding conflict of twice ten thousand years.
Ruin!—ruin!—all is ruin around us. We see not
the burying of hamlets, we hear not the descent of
avalanches, but the sky is lit up with a wan glare,
the whole air is full of mysterious sounds, and we
feel, with a strange all-pervading fear, that destruction
will glut herself ere morning. God help the
traveller who is abroad to-night!</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, with a sheer descent, full fifty fathoms
down, let us plunge like the eagle when he shoots
before the burning thunderbolt. We are on the wide
ocean, and what a sight! Sea and air are commingled
into one. You seem buried alive in a whirling tempest
of snow-flakes, and though, as on the mountain,
you hear on every side sounds of utter agony, yet, as
there, the keenest eye cannot penetrate the wan, dim
prospect around; but here, unlike on the hills, there
is one voice superior to all the rest—the deep, awful
bass of the rolling surges. And then the hurricane!
How it whistles, roars and bellows through the rigging,
now piping shrill and clear, and now groaning
awfully as if in its last extremity. The snow is
blocking up the decks, wet, spongy and bitterly cold.
There! how she thumped against that wave, quivering
under it in every timber, while the spray was
dimly seen flying wild and high over the fore-top.
“Shall we—oh! shall we live till morning?” asks a
weeping girl. “We know not, sweet one, but we
are in the Almighty’s hand, and his fatherly care will
be over us as well here as on the land.” There; see—“<span class='sc'>hold
on all</span>,” thunders the Stentor voice of the
skipper, sounding now however fainter than the
feeblest infant’s cry; and as he speaks, the craft
shivers with a convulsive throe, and a gigantic billow,
seething, hissing, flashing, whirls in over the
bow, deluges the deck, and roars away into the blackness
of darkness astern. Was that a cry of <span class='sc'>a man
overboard</span>? God in his infinite mercy, pardon the
poor wretch’s sins; for, alas! it were madness to
attempt his rescue. Already he is far astern. Another
and another wave! Oh! for the light of morning.
Yes! young Jessie, thou would’st give worlds
now for the breezes of the far-off land—the hum
of bees, the songs of birds, the scent of flowers in
the summer sunshine—the sight of thy home
smiling amidst its murmuring trees, with the clear
brook hard by laughing over the stones, and the
voices of thy young sisters sounding gaily in thy ears.
But ere morning we may all be with our brother who
has but just gone from our midst. <span class='it'>Ora pro nobis!</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>We were but dreaming when we thought ourselves
among the mountains and on the sea, and we were
awoke by thy soft voice—oh! loved one of our soul—and
looking into thy blue eyes—moist, not with
tears, but with thine all-sensitive soul—we feel a
calm come down upon us soothing, how gently and
sweetly, our agitated thoughts. Many and many a
tale could we tell thee of sorrow and peril on the
seas, and our heart is even now full of one which
would bring the tears into other eyes than thine—but
no! you tell us we are all too agitated by our
dream, and that another time will do—well, well!
Sing us, then, one of thine own sweet songs—Melanie!—for
is not thy voice like the warbler of our
woods, he of the hundred notes, the silvery, the
melting, the unrivalled? That was sweetly done—ever
could we sit and listen to thee thus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is Lowell’s—a noble soul is his, and all on
fire with poetry. We tender to him, though we have
never met in the flesh, our good right hand, joining
his herewith in cordial fellowship, the hearts of both
being in our eyes the while:—we tender him our
hand—he far away in his student’s room at Boston
and we here in old Philadelphia—and we tell sneering
worldlings and critics who are born only to be
damned, that, for one so young, Lowell has written
grandly; that he is full, even to overflowing, of purity,
enthusiasm, imagination, and love for all God’s creatures;
and being this, why should not we—aye! and
all honest men beside—grasp him cheerily by the
hand, and if need be, stand to our arms in his defence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the clock has struck six, and we will walk to
the door to see if the tempest still rages. What a
glorious night! The moon is out, sailing high up in
heaven, with a calm mystic majesty that fills the soul
with untold peace. Far away on the horizon floats a
misty veil—while here and there, in the sky, a cloud
still lingers, its dark body seeming like velvet on an
azure ground, and its edges turned up with silver.
There are a thousand stars on the frosty snow; for
every tiny crystal that shoots out into the moonshine
glistens all diamond-like; and, as you walk, ten thousand
new crystals open to the light, until the whole
landscape seems alive with millions of gems. Hark!
how the hard crust crackles under the tread. If you
put your ear to the ground you will hear a multitude
of almost inarticulate sounds as if the sharp moon-beams
were splintering the snow—but it is only the
shooting of myriads of crystals. There have been
icicles forming all day from yonder twig, and now as
we shake the tree, you may hear them tinkling, one by
one, to the ground, with a clear silvery tone, like the
ringing of a bell miles off among the hills. Early in
the afternoon, the snow melted on the river, but
towards nightfall the stream became clogged, and
now the frost is “breathing a blue film” from shore
to shore—and to-morrow the whole surface will be
smooth as glass, and the steel of the skater will be
ringing sharp along the ice. How keen was that
gust!—you may hear its dying cadence moaning
away in the distance, like the wail of a lost child in
a forest. Hush! was that a whistle down in the
wood?</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now again all is still. Let us pause a moment
and look around. The well-known landmarks of the
scene have disappeared, giving place to an unbroken
prospect of the purest white. We seem to have
entered into a new world, and to have lost by the
transition all our old and more selfish feelings, so
that now, every emotion of our heart is softened
down to a gentle calm, in unison with the beauty and
repose around us. There is a dreaminess in the landscape,
thus half seen by the light of the moon, giving
full play to the imagination. The spirit spurns
this mortal tenement of clay, and soars upwards to a
brighter world, holding fancied communion with the
myriads of beatified spirits, which it would fain
believe, hover in the air and whisper unseen into our
souls. Glorious thought, that God hath appointed
such guardian watchers over a lost and sinful race!
We would not surrender this belief—wild and visionary
as it may seem to some—for all that sectarians
have asserted or atheists denied. We love, in the
still watches of the night, to think that the “loved
and lost” are communing with our hearts—that
though dead they yet live, and watch, as of old, over
our erring path—that they soothe us in sorrow,
hover around our beds of sickness, are the first to
bear the parted soul upwards to the gates of Paradise—and
that the angelic sounds we hear upon the midnight
air, coming we know not whither, but seeming
to pervade the whole firmament as with a celestial
harmony, are but their songs of praise. Or may not
these heavenly strains be the cadences which faintly
float, far down from the battlements of heaven?</p>

<p class='line0'>Like the slow dying of an autumn blast.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>A lonely monk is loitering within</p>
<p class='line0'>The dusky area, at the altar seen,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like a pale spirit, kneeling in the light</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the cold moon, that looketh wan and white</p>
<p class='line0'>Through the deviced oriel; and he lays</p>
<p class='line0'>His hands upon his bosom, with a gaze</p>
<p class='line0'>To the chill earth. He had the youthful look</p>
<p class='line0'>Which heartfelt woe had wasted, and he shook</p>
<p class='line0'>At every gust of the unholy breeze</p>
<p class='line0'>That entered through the time-worn crevices.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>A score of summers only o’er his brow</p>
<p class='line0'>Had passed—and it was summer, even now</p>
<p class='line0'>The one-and-twentieth—from a birth of tears,</p>
<p class='line0'>Over a waste of melancholy years!</p>
<p class='line0'>And <span class='it'>that</span> brow was as wan as if it were</p>
<p class='line0'>Of snowy marble, and the raven hair,</p>
<p class='line0'>That would have clustered over, was all shorn,</p>
<p class='line0'>And his fine features stricken pale as morn.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He kiss’d a golden crucifix, that hung</p>
<p class='line0'>Around his neck, and, in a transport, flung</p>
<p class='line0'>Himself upon the earth, and said, and said</p>
<p class='line0'>Wild, raving words, about the blessed dead;</p>
<p class='line0'>And then he rose, and in the moon-shade stood,</p>
<p class='line0'>Gazing upon its light in solitude,</p>
<p class='line0'>And smote his brow, at some idea wild</p>
<p class='line0'>That came across; then, weeping like a child,</p>
<p class='line0'>He faltered out the name of Agathè,</p>
<p class='line0'>And look’d unto the heaven inquiringly,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the pure stars.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;“Oh, shame! that ye are met</p>
<p class='line0'>To mock me, like old memories, that yet</p>
<p class='line0'>Break in upon the golden dream I knew</p>
<p class='line0'>While she—<span class='it'>she</span> lived; and I have said adieu</p>
<p class='line0'>To that fair one, and to her sister, Peace,</p>
<p class='line0'>That lieth in her grave. When wilt thou cease</p>
<p class='line0'>To feed upon my quiet, thou Despair,</p>
<p class='line0'>That art the mad usurper, and the heir</p>
<p class='line0'>Of this heart’s heritage? Go, go—return,</p>
<p class='line0'>And bring me back oblivion and an urn!</p>
<p class='line0'>And ye, pale stars, may look, and only find</p>
<p class='line0'>The wreck of a proud tree, that lets the wind</p>
<p class='line0'>Count o’er its blighted boughs: for such was he</p>
<p class='line0'>That loved, and loves, the silent Agathè.”</p>
<p class='line0'>And he hath left the sanctuary, like one</p>
<p class='line0'>That knew not his own purpose—the red sun</p>
<p class='line0'>Rose early over incense of bright mist,</p>
<p class='line0'>That girded a pure sky of amethyst.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And who was he? A monk. And those who knew,</p>
<p class='line0'>Yclept him Julio; but they were few.</p>
<p class='line0'>And others named him as a nameless one,—</p>
<p class='line0'>A dark, sad-hearted being, who had none</p>
<p class='line0'>But bitter feelings, and a cast of sadness,</p>
<p class='line0'>That fed the wildest of all curses—madness!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But he was, what none knew, of lordly line,</p>
<p class='line0'>That fought in the far land of Palestine,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where, under banners of the Cross, they fell,</p>
<p class='line0'>Smote by the armies of the infidel.</p>
<p class='line0'>And Julio was the last; alone, alone,</p>
<p class='line0'>A sad, unfriended orphan, that had gone</p>
<p class='line0'>Into the world to murmur and to die,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like the cold breezes that are passing by!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And few they were that bade him to their board;</p>
<p class='line0'>His fortunes now were over, and the sword</p>
<p class='line0'>Of his proud ancestry dishonor’d—left</p>
<p class='line0'>To moulder in its sheath—a hated gift!</p>
<p class='line0'>Ay! it was so; and Julio would fain</p>
<p class='line0'>Have been a warrior; but his very brain</p>
<p class='line0'>Grew fever’d at the sickly thought of death.</p>
<p class='line0'>And to be stricken with a want of breath!—</p>
<p class='line0'>To be the food of worms—inanimate,</p>
<p class='line0'>And cold as winter—and as desolate!</p>
<p class='line0'>And then to waste away, and be no more</p>
<p class='line0'>Than the dark dust!—the thought was like a sore</p>
<p class='line0'>That gather’d in his heart; and he would say,</p>
<p class='line0'>“A curse be on their laurels,” and decay</p>
<p class='line0'>Came over them; the deeds that they had done</p>
<p class='line0'>Had fallen with their fortunes; and anon</p>
<p class='line0'>Was Julio forgotten, and his line—</p>
<p class='line0'>No wonder for this frenzied tale of mine!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Oh! he was wearied of this passing scene!</p>
<p class='line0'>But loved not death; his purpose was between</p>
<p class='line0'>Life and the grave; and it would vibrate there</p>
<p class='line0'>Like a wild bird, that floated far and fair</p>
<p class='line0'>Betwixt the sun and sea.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;He went, and came—</p>
<p class='line0'>And thought, and slept, and still awoke the same—</p>
<p class='line0'>A strange, strange youth; and he would look all night</p>
<p class='line0'>Upon the moon and stars, and count the flight</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the sea waves, and let the evening wind</p>
<p class='line0'>Play with his raven tresses, or would bind</p>
<p class='line0'>Grottos of birch, wherein to sit and sing;</p>
<p class='line0'>And peasant girls would find him sauntering,</p>
<p class='line0'>To gaze upon their features, as they met,</p>
<p class='line0'>In laughter, under some green arboret.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>At last he became a monk, and, on his knees,</p>
<p class='line0'>Said holy prayers, and with wild penances</p>
<p class='line0'>Made sad atonement; and the solemn whim</p>
<p class='line0'>That, like a shadow, loiter’d over him,</p>
<p class='line0'>Wore off, even like a shadow. He was cursed</p>
<p class='line0'>With none of the mad thoughts that were at first</p>
<p class='line0'>The poison of his quiet; but he grew</p>
<p class='line0'>To love the world and its wild laughter too,</p>
<p class='line0'>As he had known before: and wish’d again</p>
<p class='line0'>To join the very mirth he hated then.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He durst not break the vow—he durst not be</p>
<p class='line0'>The one he would—and his heart’s harmony</p>
<p class='line0'>Became a tide of sorrow. Even so,</p>
<p class='line0'>He felt hope die—in madness and in wo!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But there came one—and a most lovely one</p>
<p class='line0'>As ever to the warm light of the sun</p>
<p class='line0'>Threw back her tresses—a fair sister girl,</p>
<p class='line0'>With a brow changing between snow and pearl;</p>
<p class='line0'>And the blue eyes of sadness, filled with dew</p>
<p class='line0'>Of tears—like Heaven’s own melancholy blue—</p>
<p class='line0'>So beautiful, so tender; and her form</p>
<p class='line0'>Was graceful as a rainbow in a storm:</p>
<p class='line0'>Scattering gladness on the face of sorrow—</p>
<p class='line0'>Oh! I had fancied of the hues that borrow</p>
<p class='line0'>Their brightness from the sun; but she was bright</p>
<p class='line0'>In her own self—a mystery of light!</p>
<p class='line0'>With feelings tender as a star’s own hue,</p>
<p class='line0'>Pure as the morning star! as true, as true:</p>
<p class='line0'>For it will glitter in each early sky,</p>
<p class='line0'>And her first love be love that lasteth aye!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And this was Agathè—young Agathè—</p>
<p class='line0'>A motherless, fair girl: and many a day</p>
<p class='line0'>She wept for her lost parent. It was sad</p>
<p class='line0'>To see her infant sorrow; how she bade</p>
<p class='line0'>The flow of her wild spirits fall away</p>
<p class='line0'>To grief, like bright clouds in a summer day</p>
<p class='line0'>Melting into a shower; and it was sad</p>
<p class='line0'>Almost to think she might again be glad—</p>
<p class='line0'>Her beauty was so chaste, amid the fall</p>
<p class='line0'>Of her bright tears. Yet in her father’s hall</p>
<p class='line0'>She had lived almost sorrowless her days;</p>
<p class='line0'>But he felt no affection for the gaze</p>
<p class='line0'>Of his fair girl; and when she fondly smiled,</p>
<p class='line0'>He bade no father’s welcome to the child,</p>
<p class='line0'>But even told his wish, and will’d it done,</p>
<p class='line0'>For her to be sad-hearted—and a nun!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And so it was. She took the dreary veil,</p>
<p class='line0'>A hopeless girl! and the bright flush grew pale</p>
<p class='line0'>Upon her cheek; she felt, as summer feels</p>
<p class='line0'>The winds of autumn, and the winter chills</p>
<p class='line0'>That darken his fair suns—it was away,</p>
<p class='line0'>Feeding on dreams, the heart of Agathè!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>The vesper prayers were said, and the last hymn</p>
<p class='line0'>Sung to the Holy Virgin. In the dim,</p>
<p class='line0'>Gray aisle, was heard a solitary tread,</p>
<p class='line0'>As of one musing sadly on the dead—</p>
<p class='line0'>’Twas Julio. It was his wont to be</p>
<p class='line0'>Often alone within the sanctuary;</p>
<p class='line0'>But now, not so—another: it was she!</p>
<p class='line0'>Kneeling in all her beauty, like a saint</p>
<p class='line0'>Before a crucifix; but sad and faint</p>
<p class='line0'>The tone of her devotion, as the trill</p>
<p class='line0'>Of a moss-burden’d melancholy rill.</p>
<p class='line0'>And Julio stood before her;—’twas as yet</p>
<p class='line0'>The hour of the pale twilight—and they met</p>
<p class='line0'>Each other’s gaze, till either seem’d the hue</p>
<p class='line0'>Of deepest crimson; but the ladye threw</p>
<p class='line0'>Her veil above her features, and stole by</p>
<p class='line0'>Like a bright cloud, with sadness and a sigh!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Yet Julio still stood gazing and alone,</p>
<p class='line0'>A dreamer!——“is the sister ladye gone?”</p>
<p class='line0'>He started at the silence of the air</p>
<p class='line0'>That slumber’d over him—she is not there.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And either slept not through the live-long night,</p>
<p class='line0'>Or slept in fitful trances, with a bright,</p>
<p class='line0'>Fair dream upon their eyelids: but they rose</p>
<p class='line0'>In sorrow from the pallet of repose:</p>
<p class='line0'>For the dark thought of their sad destiny</p>
<p class='line0'>Came o’er them, like a chasm of the deep sea,</p>
<p class='line0'>That was to rend their fortunes; and at eve</p>
<p class='line0'>They met again, but, silent, took their leave,</p>
<p class='line0'>As they did yesterday: another night,</p>
<p class='line0'>And neither spoke awhile—a pure delight,</p>
<p class='line0'>Had chasten’d love’s first blushes: silently</p>
<p class='line0'>Gazed Julio on the gentle Agathè—</p>
<p class='line0'>At length, “Fair Nun!” she started, and held fast</p>
<p class='line0'>Her bright hand on her lips—“the past, the past,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the pale future! there be some that lie</p>
<p class='line0'>Under those marble urns—I know not why,</p>
<p class='line0'>But I were better in that holy calm,</p>
<p class='line0'>Than be as I have been, perhaps, and am.</p>
<p class='line0'>The past!—ay! it hath perish’d; never, never,</p>
<p class='line0'>Would I recall it to be blest for ever;</p>
<p class='line0'>The future it must come—I have a vow”—</p>
<p class='line0'>And his cold hand rose trembling to his brow,</p>
<p class='line0'>“True, true, I have a vow; is not the moon</p>
<p class='line0'>Abroad, fair nun?”—“indeed! so very soon?”</p>
<p class='line0'>Said Agathè, and “I must then away.”</p>
<p class='line0'>“Stay, love! ’tis early yet; stay, angel, stay!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But she was gone:—yet they met many a time</p>
<p class='line0'>In the lone chapel, after vesper chime—</p>
<p class='line0'>They met in love and fear.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;One weary day,</p>
<p class='line0'>And Julio saw not his loved Agathè;</p>
<p class='line0'>She was not in the choir of sisterhood</p>
<p class='line0'>That sang the evening anthem; and he stood</p>
<p class='line0'>Like one that listen’d breathlessly awhile;</p>
<p class='line0'>But stranger voices chanted through the aisle.</p>
<p class='line0'>She was not there; and after all were gone,</p>
<p class='line0'>He linger’d: the stars came—he linger’d on,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like a dark fun’ral image on the tomb</p>
<p class='line0'>Of a lost hope. He felt a world of gloom</p>
<p class='line0'>Upon his heart—a solitude—a chill.</p>
<p class='line0'>The pale moon rose, and still he linger’d still.</p>
<p class='line0'>And the next vesper toll’d; nor yet, nor yet—</p>
<p class='line0'>“Can Agathè be faithless and forget?”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>It was the third sad eve, he heard it said,</p>
<p class='line0'>“Poor Julio! thy Agathè is dead;”</p>
<p class='line0'>And started. He had loiter’d in the train</p>
<p class='line0'>That bore her to the grave: he saw her lain</p>
<p class='line0'>In the cold earth, and heard a requiem</p>
<p class='line0'>Sung over her. To him it was a dream:</p>
<p class='line0'>A marble stone stood by the sepulchre;</p>
<p class='line0'>He look’d, and saw, and started—she was there!</p>
<p class='line0'>And Agathè had died: she that was bright—</p>
<p class='line0'>She that was in her beauty! a cold blight</p>
<p class='line0'>Fell over the young blossom of her brow,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the life’s blood grew chill—she is not now.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>She died like Zephyr falling amid flowers!</p>
<p class='line0'>Like to a star within the twilight hours</p>
<p class='line0'>Of morning—and she was not! Some have thought</p>
<p class='line0'>The Lady Abbess gave her a mad draught</p>
<p class='line0'>That stole into her heart, and sadly rent</p>
<p class='line0'>The fine chords of that holy instrument,</p>
<p class='line0'>Until its music falter’d fast away,</p>
<p class='line0'>And she—she died—the lovely Agathè!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Again, and through the arras of the gloom</p>
<p class='line0'>Are the pale breezes moaning: by her tomb</p>
<p class='line0'>Bends Julio, like a phantom, and his eye</p>
<p class='line0'>Is fallen, as the moon-borne tides, that lie</p>
<p class='line0'>At ebb within the sea. Oh! he is wan,</p>
<p class='line0'>As winter skies are wan, like ages gone,</p>
<p class='line0'>And stars unseen for paleness; it is cast,</p>
<p class='line0'>As foliage in the raving of the blast,</p>
<p class='line0'>All his fair bloom of thoughts. Is the moon chill,</p>
<p class='line0'>That in the dark clouds she is mantled still?</p>
<p class='line0'>And over its proud arch hath Heaven flung</p>
<p class='line0'>A scarf of darkness. Agathè was young!</p>
<p class='line0'>And there should be the virgin silver there,</p>
<p class='line0'>The snow-white fringes delicately fair!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He wields a heavy mattock in his hands,</p>
<p class='line0'>And over him a lonely lanthorn stands</p>
<p class='line0'>On a near niche, shedding a sickly fall</p>
<p class='line0'>Of light upon a marble pedestal,</p>
<p class='line0'>Whereon is chisel’d rudely, the essay</p>
<p class='line0'>Of untaught tool, “<span class='it'>Hic jacet Agathè</span>,”</p>
<p class='line0'>And Julio hath bent him down in speed,</p>
<p class='line0'>like one that doeth an unholy deed.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>There is a flagstone lieth heavily</p>
<p class='line0'>Over the ladye’s grave; I wist of three</p>
<p class='line0'>That bore it of a blessed verity!</p>
<p class='line0'>But he hath lifted it in his pure madness</p>
<p class='line0'>As it were lightsome as a summer gladness,</p>
<p class='line0'>And from the carved niche hath ta’en the lamp</p>
<p class='line0'>And hung it by the marble flagstone damp.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And he is flinging the dark, chilly mould</p>
<p class='line0'>Over the gorgeous pavement: ’tis a cold,</p>
<p class='line0'>Sad grave; and there is many a relic there</p>
<p class='line0'>Of chalky bones, which, in the wasting air,</p>
<p class='line0'>Fell mouldering away: and he would dash</p>
<p class='line0'>His mattock through them with a cursed clash</p>
<p class='line0'>That made the lone aisle echo. But anon</p>
<p class='line0'>He fell upon a skull—a haggard one,</p>
<p class='line0'>With its teeth set, and the great orbless eye</p>
<p class='line0'>Revolving darkness, like eternity.</p>
<p class='line0'>And in his hand he held it till it grew</p>
<p class='line0'>To have the fleshy features and the hue</p>
<p class='line0'>Of life. He gazed, and gazed, and it became</p>
<p class='line0'>Like to his Agathè—all, all the same!</p>
<p class='line0'>He drew it nearer,—the cold, bony thing!—</p>
<p class='line0'>To kiss the worm-wet lips. “Aye! let me cling—</p>
<p class='line0'>Cling to thee now forever!”—but a breath</p>
<p class='line0'>Of rank corruption, from its jaws of death,</p>
<p class='line0'>Went to his nostrils, and he madly laugh’d,</p>
<p class='line0'>And dash’d it over on the altar shaft,</p>
<p class='line0'>Which the new-risen moon, in her gray light,</p>
<p class='line0'>Had fondly flooded, beautifully bright!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Again he went</p>
<p class='line0'>To his world work beside the monument.</p>
<p class='line0'>“Ha! leave, thou moon! where thy footfall hath been</p>
<p class='line0'>In sorrow amid heaven! there is sin</p>
<p class='line0'>Under thy shadow, lying like a dew;</p>
<p class='line0'>So come thou, from thy awful arch of blue,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where thou art ever as a silver throne</p>
<p class='line0'>For some pale spectre-king! come thou alone,</p>
<p class='line0'>Or bring a solitary orphan star</p>
<p class='line0'>Under thy wings! afar, afar, afar,</p>
<p class='line0'>To gaze upon this girl of radiancy,</p>
<p class='line0'>In her deep slumbers—wake thee, Agathè!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>And Julio hath stolen the dark chest</p>
<p class='line0'>Where the fair nun lay coffin’d, in the rest</p>
<p class='line0'>That wakes not up at morning; she is there</p>
<p class='line0'>An image of cold calm! One tress of hair</p>
<p class='line0'>Lingereth lonely on her snowy brow;</p>
<p class='line0'>But the bright eyes are closed in darkness now;</p>
<p class='line0'>And their long lashes delicately rest</p>
<p class='line0'>On the pale cheek, like sun-rays in the west,</p>
<p class='line0'>That fall upon a colorless sad cloud.</p>
<p class='line0'>Humility lies rudely on the proud,</p>
<p class='line0'>But she was never proud; and there she is,</p>
<p class='line0'>A yet unwither’d flower the autumn breeze</p>
<p class='line0'>Hath blown from its green stem! ’Tis pale, ’Tis pale,</p>
<p class='line0'>But still unfaded, like the twilight veil</p>
<p class='line0'>That falleth after sunset; like a stream</p>
<p class='line0'>That bears the burden of a silver gleam</p>
<p class='line0'>Upon its waters; and is even so,—</p>
<p class='line0'>Chill, melancholy, lustreless, and low!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Beauty in death! a tenderness upon</p>
<p class='line0'>The rude and silent relics, where alone</p>
<p class='line0'>Sat the destroyer! Beauty on the dead!</p>
<p class='line0'>The look of being where the breath is fled!</p>
<p class='line0'>The unwarming sun still joyous in its light!</p>
<p class='line0'>A time—a time without a day or night!</p>
<p class='line0'>Death cradled upon beauty, like a bee</p>
<p class='line0'>Upon a flower, that looketh lovingly!</p>
<p class='line0'>Like a wild serpent, coiling in its madness,</p>
<p class='line0'>Under a wreath of blossom and of gladness!</p>

<p class='line0'>And there she is; and Julio bends o’er</p>
<p class='line0'>The sleeping girl—a willow on the shore</p>
<p class='line0'>Of a Dead Sea! that steepeth its fair bough</p>
<p class='line0'>Into the bitter waters,—even now</p>
<p class='line0'>Taking a foretaste of the awful trance</p>
<p class='line0'>That was to pass on his own countenance!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>Yes! yes! and he is holding his pale lips</p>
<p class='line0'>Over her brow; the shade of an eclipse</p>
<p class='line0'>Is passing to his heart, and to his eye</p>
<p class='line0'>That is not tearful; but the light will die</p>
<p class='line0'>Leaving it like a moon within a mist,—</p>
<p class='line0'>The vision of a spell-bound visionist!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;He breathed a cold kiss on her ashy cheek,</p>
<p class='line0'>That left no trace—no flush—no crimson streak</p>
<p class='line0'>But was as bloodless as a marble stone,</p>
<p class='line0'>Susceptible of silent waste alone.</p>
<p class='line0'>And on her brow a crucifix he laid,—</p>
<p class='line0'>A jewel’d crucifix, the virgin maid</p>
<p class='line0'>Had given him before she died,—the moon</p>
<p class='line0'>Shed light upon her visage—clouded soon,</p>
<p class='line0'>Then briefly breaking from its airy veil,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like warrior lifting up his aventayle.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>But Julio gazed on, and never lifted</p>
<p class='line0'>Himself to see the broken clouds, that drifted</p>
<p class='line0'>One after one, like infant elves at play,</p>
<p class='line0'>Amid the night winds, in their lonely way—</p>
<p class='line0'>Some whistling and some moaning, some asleep,</p>
<p class='line0'>And dreaming dismal dreams, and sighing deep</p>
<p class='line0'>Over their couches of green moss and flowers,</p>
<p class='line0'>And solitary fern, and heather bowers.</p>
<p class='line0'>The heavy bell toll’d two, and, as it toll’d,</p>
<p class='line0'>Julio started, and the fresh-turn’d mould</p>
<p class='line0'>He flung into the empty chasm with speed,</p>
<p class='line0'>And o’er it dropt the flagstone.—One could read</p>
<p class='line0'>That Agathè lay there; but still the girl</p>
<p class='line0'>Lay by him, like a precious and pale pearl,</p>
<p class='line0'>That from the deep sea-waters had been rent—</p>
<p class='line0'>Like a star fallen from the firmament!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He hides the grave-tools in an aged porch,</p>
<p class='line0'>To westward of the solitary church:</p>
<p class='line0'>And he hath clasp’d around the melting waist,</p>
<p class='line0'>The beautiful, dead girl: his cheek is pressed</p>
<p class='line0'>To hers—life warming the cold chill of death!</p>
<p class='line0'>And over his pale palsy breathing breath</p>
<p class='line0'>His eye is sunk upon her—“Thou must leave</p>
<p class='line0'>The worm to waste for love of thee, and grieve</p>
<p class='line0'>Without thee, as I may not.—Thou must go,</p>
<p class='line0'>My sweet betrothed, with me—but not below,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where there is darkness, dream, and solitude,</p>
<p class='line0'>But where is light, and life, and one to brood</p>
<p class='line0'>Above thee till thou wakest.—Ha? I fear</p>
<p class='line0'>Thou wilt not wake for ever, sleeping here,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where there are none but winds to visit thee,</p>
<p class='line0'>And convent fathers, and a choristry</p>
<p class='line0'>Of sisters, saying, ‘Hush!’—But I will sing</p>
<p class='line0'>Rare songs to thy pure spirit, wandering</p>
<p class='line0'>Down on the dews to heaven: I will tune</p>
<p class='line0'>The instrument of the ethereal noon,</p>
<p class='line0'>And all the choir of stars, to rise and fall</p>
<p class='line0'>In harmony and beauty musical.”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>He is away—and still the sickly lamp</p>
<p class='line0'>Is burning next the altar; there’s a damp,</p>
<p class='line0'>Thin mould upon the pavement, and, at morn,</p>
<p class='line0'>The monks do cross them in their blessed scorn,</p>
<p class='line0'>And mutter deep anathemas, because</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the unholy sacrilege, that was</p>
<p class='line0'>Within the sainted chapel,—for they guess’d,</p>
<p class='line0'>By many a vestige sad, how the dark rest</p>
<p class='line0'>Of Agathè was broken,—and anon</p>
<p class='line0'>They sought for Julio. The summer sun</p>
<p class='line0'>Arose and set, with his imperial disc</p>
<p class='line0'>Toward the ocean-waters, heaving brisk</p>
<p class='line0'>Before the winds,—but Julio came never:</p>
<p class='line0'>He that was frantic as a foaming river—</p>
<p class='line0'>Mad as the fall of leaves upon the tide</p>
<p class='line0'>Of a great tempest, that hath fought and died</p>
<p class='line0'>Along the forest ramparts, and doth still</p>
<p class='line0'>In its death-struggle desperately reel</p>
<p class='line0'>Round with the fallen foliage—he was gone,</p>
<p class='line0'>And none knew whither—still were chanted on</p>
<p class='line0'>Sad masses, by pale sisters, many a day,</p>
<p class='line0'>And holy requiem sung for Agathè!</p>

<p class='line' style='font-size:0.9em;'>“ ’Tis all but a dream at the best!”</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Dreams</span> of the Land and Sea! Why should I
style them dreams? They are pictures of actual
scenes, though some of them relate to events removed
far back in the dimness of years, and the
touches of the brush have felt the mellowing influence
of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While striving to avoid whatever is irrelevant or
out of keeping, I have not endeavored to confine myself,
in these sketches, within the limits of simple narrative,
but have ventured occasionally to mingle facts
with speculations on their causes, or to follow their
consequences to probable results: nor have I totally
discarded the imagination—although the scenes are
invariably drawn from nature, and the principal personages
are real characters—the accessory actors
only are sometimes creatures of the brain. In many of
the descriptions, the reader will perceive the evidences
of a desire to place in prominent relief the
works of nature and her God, while art, and all its vanities,
is made to play a subordinate part; for nothing
can be more impertinently obtrusive than the pigmy
efforts of the ambitious, struggling for distinction by
attempting either to mar or to perfect the plans of the
Great Architect of Creation, or carve <span class='it'>a name</span> upon
the columns of his temple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet such is the social disposition of man, that no
scene, however grand or beautiful, can awaken pleasurable
emotion unless it is linked directly with humanity.
There is deep oppression in the sense of
total loneliness,—and few can bear the burden
calmly, even for an hour! A solitary foot-print in
the desert,—a broken oar upon the shelterless beach,—the
tinkling of a cow-bell in the depth of the forest,—the
crowing of the cock heard far off in the
valley as we sink exhausted on the mountain side
when the gloom of night settles heavily down upon
our path-way,—who that has been a wanderer has
not felt the heart-cheering effect of accidents like
these! They tell us that, though our solitude be profound,
there is sympathy near us, <span class='it'>or there has been
recently</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In deference, then, to this universal feeling, I have
selected for these articles such sketches only as are
interwoven with enough of human life to awaken
social interest, even while grappling with the tempest—riding
the ocean wave, or watching the moon-beams
as they struggle through the foliage of scarce
trodden forests, and fall half quenched, upon the
withered leaves below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But why should I style them dreams? There are
many valid reasons. To the writer, the past is all a
dream! But of this the world knows nothing, nor
would it care to know. The scenes described are
distant, and distance itself is dreamy! What can be
more like the color of a dream than yon long range
of mountains fading into the sky behind its veil of
mist!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us ascend this lofty peak! ’Tis sunset! Cast
your glance westward, where</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun slowly retires behind the far off hills.
Inch after inch, the shadows climb the summit where
you stand. He is gone!—yet you are not in darkness!
His beams, which reach you not, still gild
the motionless clouds, and these emblems of obscurity
reflect on you the memory of his glory:—and,
oh! how exquisitely pencilled in the clear obscure
stands forth yon range, clad with towering trees,
where each particular branch, and almost every leaf,
seems separately portrayed against the paling sky,—<span class='it'>miraculously
near</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is a vision of the <span class='it'>past</span>. Its strength is owing
to the depth of shade,—not to the intensity of light:—for,
when the sun at noon-day, poured its full tide
of rays upon the scene, the sky was brighter, and
rock and river glinted back the flashing beams until
the eye was pained:—but where were then those
lines of beauty? The details were distinct. Then
you might gaze on the forest in its reality, and could
almost penetrate its secret paths, despite their dark
green canopy!—but where were the broad effect,
the bold, sweeping outlines that now give unity and
grandeur to the fading scene? The <span class='it'>soul</span> of creation
is before you—more palpable than <span class='it'>its mere</span> corporeal
elements are hid from sight. It resembles the master-piece
of some great artist whose pencil portrays,
in simple light and shade, a noble picture. All there
is <span class='it'>life</span>! Those countenances!—those various attitudes
are <span class='it'>speaking</span>! The shrubbery waves in the
wind, and over the tremulous waters of that lovely
lake, the very song of yonder mountain maid seems
floating <span class='it'>upon the canvass</span>. Do you not hear the
music? ’Tis but a dream of boyhood! Approach
the painting! There is no <span class='it'>real</span> outline there! The
brush has been rudely dashed athwart the piece surcharged
with heavy colors. Masses of many hues
roughen the surface, and all is meaningless confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stand back a-pace! Again the cottage, lake and
mountain start from the surface, <span class='it'>truer than truth
itself</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Panting with sighs and toil, man reaches by painful
steps, the mid-land height of life, as we have
climbed this summit, and when fainting by the way,
it has been <span class='it'>his</span> resource, as <span class='it'>ours</span>, to cast himself upon
the bosom of his “mother,” earth<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a>—look back and
<span class='it'>dream</span>! We have no other mother now! But when
you nestled to a parent’s breast, and felt the present
impress of her love, knew you its breadth and depth
as this vision shows it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Memory is like the painter or the sun-set—its
images appear more real than the substantial things
they picture, and glow the richer as the gloom of
oblivion gathers around them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turn your eyes eastward! Night sits upon the
landscape. No ray of the past illuminates it. The
very elevation on which you stand increases the
darkness with its shadow, while it widens your distance
from every object vaguely and fearfully looming
through the evening mist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is a vision of the <span class='it'>future</span>. That height of land
which seems to reach the clouds, upon whose dusky
flank the overawed imagination figures cave and
precipice, torrent and cataract, is but a gentle slope,
with just enough of rudeness to render still more
beautiful by contrast, the village spire, the moss-roofed
mill, the waving grain that crowns its very
top. Such it is seen by day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, when, in middle life, man peers into the
future, what frightful shadows haunt him. Coming
events magnified to giants by the obscurity around,
stalk menacingly forward. Danger threatens him at
every step, and there is naught beyond but that black
back-ground—<span class='it'>Death</span>! The heavens shed no light
upon the future. He is descending the hill of life,
and their glories are fading behind him. He strives
to borrow from the past a gleam to guide him onward,
but in vain! Too often his own ambition has prompted
him to choose the lofty path that now condemns him
to redoubled darkness. Yet, although these spectres
of the gloom are most frequently mere creatures of
the brain, which day-light would dispel, they govern
his career and cover him with dread. The <span class='it'>dream</span> is
<span class='it'>truth</span> to him—and it is only <span class='it'>truth itself</span> that he
esteems a <span class='it'>dream</span>! Why can he not wait for sun-rise!
Then should he see even the grave overhung with
the verdure of spring, and death arrayed in all the
glory of a morn of promise!</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is reality in dreams!—Come, then, and let
us dream together!—our visions may be dark sometimes,
but we will not forget that the sun will rise
on the morrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Every</span> subject of observation presents itself under
a variety of aspects, regulated, not only by the situation
of the observer, but by his moral peculiarities
also. The little animal whose name dignifies the
caption of this article, though it may be better
known to many of my readers by the title of ground-hog,
or wood-chuck, is usually regarded as a terror,
or a pest, to the farmer. Contributing in no appreciable
degree to the comfort or advantage of man,
and seemingly created solely for the purpose of digging
unsightly holes in the ground, eating corn, and
diffusing an odour by no means agreeable; it is commonly
hated or despised, according to the profession
of those who honor it with notice. But nothing that
springs from creative wisdom is a proper subject for
contempt, and good may be derived, in many instances,
from the most unpromising sources, by those
who devote themselves to the study of nature.
Among the tribes of animals that seem to have least
connection with man and his interests, there are
many whose habits may teach us more effective
lessons than we often derive from the homilies of
more pretending instructors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The individual wood-chuck, here introduced to the
reader, was more fortunate than most of his species,
for he had succeeded in winning the affections of a
worthy agriculturalist, in whose family he was regularly
domiciliated during the months of his activity,
(for the Marmot is a hybernating animal,) and he reciprocated
the attachment of his human protectors
with a gratitude apparently as warm as that of any
other quadruped familiar of the kitchen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The late distinguished philanthropist, Mr. Anthony
Benezette, extended his benevolence to every thing
possessing life that came within the sphere of his
influence, and he regularly fed the rats in his cellar,
until he attracted a colony of these predatory vermin,
by no means agreeable to the taste or interest
of his next-door neighbor. When the latter at last
endeavored to eradicate the nuisance by regularly
shooting every adventurous member of the murine
fraternity that ventured upon his premises, Mr.
B., with tears in his eyes, protested against this
murderous proceeding. “Don’t shoot the poor innocent
creatures!” he said. “If thou wilt only feed
them regularly every day, as I do, they’ll never do
thee any harm.” Whether a similar policy had been
the origin of the kindness shown our little friend,
the Marmot, I know not, but he had the felicity to
be born in a land where corn is cheap, and society
difficult of access, and he probably owed his protection
to a masculine edition of the feeling that so frequently
promotes the happiness of a poodle or a
parrot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His guardian moved in a humble sphere, and
most travellers might have passed the brute and his
human associates alike unnoticed: but I propose to
employ him as a hook, on which to hang the observations
and reflections of a day in the woods, and a
night in the log-cabin. It is a slender theme at best,
and if discretion be the test of wisdom, I know not
but our Marmot displays as high a grade of intellectual
endowment as any of the other actors in the
tale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of these was an eastern merchant, who had
purchased some thousands of acres of land—wild,
lonely, and far removed from practicable roads or
navigable streams.—He had purchased it in utter ignorance
of its resources, and was then upon his way
to give it an inspection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next was the narrator—recently appointed to
a chair in a Collegiate Institution, almost embosomed
in the wilderness. He had accepted the station in a
moment of depression, all uninformed of the condition
of the country where <span class='it'>it flourished</span>, and had just
arrived to <span class='it'>blush</span> beneath the honors of the professional
gown in halls that rejoiced in a faculty—<span class='it'>lucus a
non lucendo</span>!—of three persons, and wanted but a
library, an apparatus, influence, and a class, to render
it an honor to the state that chartered it!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third was a thriving specimen of the sturdy
woodsman and pains-taking farmer of the border—the
intermediate step between the adventurous pioneer
and the established settler. He had emigrated
from the beautiful valley of the Connecticut—a valley
where nature has done so much and man so
little! to seek a more promising asylum west of the
Alleghany Mountains, and he carried all his fortune
with him. A young and lovely wife followed his
footsteps from town to town—from wilderness to wilderness.—An
axe was on his shoulder, two hundred
dollars in his pocket, and he possessed much of that
shrewdness which ordinarily passes current for talent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was moderate in his desires, <span class='it'>and only took up
three hundred acres to begin with</span>; choosing a location
where a rude and cellarless hut of logs graced
one angle of the plot of ground,—its site selected because
a spring and streamlet there supplied the most
important necessary of life—good water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Four acres of unfenced clearing marked the progress
of his less prosperous predecessor in taming
the primeval forest. Alas! The want of capital!—Two
years of bootless labor on the part of that predecessor,
left the ground encumbered still with
girdled timber. The long and naked limbs of many
a stately tree—all sapless now—stood pale and inflexible
in the summer gale—a monument of desolation.
Some rough, irregular furrows,—ploughed
with borrowed oxen, and ornamented with the vine
of an occasional refuse potato creeping through the
starting briars and brush-wood,—alone gave evidence
of human industry; for the wilderness was
rapidly reclaiming its own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a half-burnt brand on the deserted
hearth within the hovel; but the blasts that entered
freely through the intervals between the logs,—from
which, mass by mass, the clay was falling;—had
scattered the ashes widely over the room. A rusty
tin basin on the floor, and a broken axe-helve lying
athwart the doorless lintel, completed the household
inventory. The ground had reverted to the noble
and wealthy company from whom it was originally
purchased—their funds enriched by the payment of
the first instalment, and the value of the <span class='it'>improvements</span>
added to their property.—But where is the former
owner? Probably renewing the same improvident
game in the wilds of Michigan or Wisconsin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was the home to which our adventurous representative
of the land of steady habits had introduced
his amiable and delicate wife, four years
before the time of our journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The station enjoyed many advantages. Civilization
was slowly tending thitherward, and every year
enhanced the nominal, if not the real value of the
land. Moreover, there were many neighbors to
break the tedium of life in the wilds. Nine miles to
the westward—that being the direction of the older
settlements,—there lived a veteran of two wars,
whose pension made him rich in a country where a
dollar is a rarity, and trade is carried on exclusively
by barter. He was the most important man within
the circuit of twenty miles; for he owned the only
forge. Not even the influence of Squire Tomkins,
whose aristocratical residence, five miles deeper in
the forest, was furnished with the luxury of weather-boarding,
and flanked by a regular barn and stables,
could outweigh, <span class='it'>in public opinion</span>, the claims of
one whose labors contributed so essentially to the
every-day comfort of life, if not to its preservation, in
the rude contest between the settler and nature.
Public opinion did I say?—Why! besides these
three high personages and their families, a migratory
trapper and bee-hunter on the one hand, and a
half-cast Indian basket-maker on the other, <span class='it'>there
was no public</span>; yet here was found not only public
opinion, but party feeling also—politics and sectarianism!—And
where did ever society exist without
them? But it is time to commence our journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning, during the autumn of 1828, I strolled
into the principal store of the beautiful little village
of ——, in Western Pennsylvania, to exchange the
latest paper from the American Athens, for another
daily sheet from the Commercial Emporium. An
old friend, Mr. W——, of Philadelphia, entered
at about the same time, with a map of the surrounding
counties, to enquire the road to certain tracts of
land but recently conveyed to him. A tall man, who
had seen some forty summers, but whose keen dark
eye, such as you can only find in the wilderness,
seemed to have gathered a smouldering fire, beneath
the shadow of the forest leaves, which few would
wish to wake, stept forward to give the required information.
Rude shoes, unstockinged feet, coarse
woolen pantaloons, and a hunting shirt, composed
his whole attire:—A rifle, with a richly chased silver
breeching, swinging athwart his back, raised him
above the ordinary hunter in the curious scale of
conventional rank that men acknowledge in obedience
to their nature, even in the heart of unfrequented
woods; but the cart-whip in his right hand, and a
basket of eggs hanging upon the left arm seemed
irrelevant to his other accoutrements. A finely chiselled
nose, verging on the Roman character, and a
strong habitual compression of the jaws, marked
great decision, firmness, and desperate daring—while
his manly tread, in which the foot seemed to
cling for a moment to the surface and as instantly
rose upon the toe with a slow, but elastic and graceful
motion, seemed better fitted to follow the mountain-side,
or the torrent’s track, than the dull routine
of the furrow. His traits and carriage, thus mingled
and contrasted, would have proved a puzzle to the
keenest judges of human nature,—the bar-keeper of
a hotel, or the agent of a rail-road—but his origin
was still distinctly marked, notwithstanding his
change of residence and habits, in the somewhat sharpened
expression of the face, the narrowness of the
external angle of the eye, the covert curl of the lip,
and the faintest perceptible elevation of the corresponding
corner of the mouth. He was the Connecticut
farmer of our story, on whose original stock of
character four years of close communion with bears
and deer, had engrafted <span class='it'>a twig</span> of that which graces
the western hunter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few adroitly managed questions placed him immediately
in possession of the residence, the destination,
views and purposes of my friend, the merchant;
and, in terms of courtesy, conveyed in phrase
more polished than one would anticipate from his
attire, he tendered his services as a guide, and the
best his house afforded by the way, as host,—extending
the invitation most politely to myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having long been anxious to observe what charm
in domestic life upon the borders, could so fascinate
mankind as to impel such crowds of restless adventurers
annually to plunge into the gloomy forest,
there to remain socially buried for years, until the
growth of settled population again environs them; I
immediately ordered horse, and mounting with my
Athenian friend, followed, or accompanied the light
wagon of the settler, as the road or path permitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had made but ten miles of progress, when the
farms by the way-side began to appear few and far
between. Around us, gathered, deep and more
deeply still, the shadows of tall trees, which interlocked
their arms above us, until mysterious twilight
was substituted for the bright sunshine that made its
existence known at intervals through openings in the
foliage. These were met with only where some
giant of the wilderness had laid him down in his last
repose, when the slowly gnawing tooth of time had
sapped his moss-grown trunk. Occasionally, the
wagon jolted heavily over fallen trees, where the
lightning had riven or the gale uprooted them. It
seemed a sacrilege to disturb the dread repose of nature
with our idle voices; and for miles we rode in
total silence.—How startling, then, and how incongruous
to our ears was the lively voice of our guide,
exclaiming, as we passed <span class='it'>a blaze</span>, “we shall soon
be <span class='it'>home</span> now!” Home! and here!—I gazed around
on every hand. Over the tops of the low shrubbery
the eye was carried along interminable aisles of
stately trees! Interminable arches rested on their
summits! An awful unity of gloom engulphed us!</p>

<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“High mountains are with me a feeling,”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='noindent'>And no man has rioted more wildly in scenes of solitude
and desolation. My shoulder is familiar with
the rifle, my feet with cliff and precipice, and my
arms with the torrent and breaker.—Nay! more
than this! I have stood alone in cities! The limitless
current of life has whirled and eddied by, and I
have felt no fellowship!—have felt the sternest
check of all that linked me with my kind, and buried
myself in egoism! “There runs not a drop of the
blood of Logan in the veins of any living creature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But never yet came over me the thought of <span class='it'>home</span>
with such a thrilling shudder as when the word was
spoken in those close and soul-oppressing woods!
There was no resonance from the leafy ground—no
echo from those long drawn gothic passages!
The sound fell flat upon the ear, and its very cheerfulness
of tone, deadened by the dark and inelastic
leaves, resembled the convulsive laugh of terror or
of pain!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Man is moulded for the contest. There is rapture
in the strife, be it with physical or moral evils—a
glory in the conquest, that repays the suffering! If
vanquished,—he may fly and bide his time! If
crushed,—he falls back upon his self-esteem, enfolds
his robe around him, and dies, like Cæsar—bravely!
Abroad—in calm or storm, in sun-shine or in tempest—man
feels himself the ruler, and his pride supports
him in the worst of woes; but <span class='it'>at home</span>—he
is dependent! There woman rules the emotions!—Who
ever knew a joy beside a gloomy hearth! Or
when the wearing cares of life, or the oppression of
habitual solitude has furrowed the fore-head, and
fixed the features of the wife, what husband ever
smiled again as once he smiled!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But away! Our path is onward!—soon we passed
along the margin of a precipitate descent, and the
day burst in upon us, presenting a momentary view
of a long range of hills, over which the fire had
swept in the preceding year. Brown furze and blackened
masses of charcoal covered the slope for miles,
with here and there a waving line of foliage climbing
the ascent, wherever some highland rivulet had
checked the progress of the flames, and preserved
the grass. I had thought that Nature furnished no
more spectral object than a girdled tree in a barren
clearing; but the tall gnarled trunks, with charred
and stunted limbs, that sentineled that ruined hill-side
were more spectral still!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Descending the hill, the forest again closed around
us: but presently we entered the track of a tornado—a
wind-fall. It had traversed a forest of pines—and,
for about two hundred yards in width, had made
a passage through the woods, as straight and regular
as art could have rendered it. On either hand—far
as the eye could reach—arose the unbroken wall
of verdure, a hundred feet in height, while in the
midst, the vision stretched away over an almost
level carpet of scrub-oak and whortleberries, forming
a vista of unparalleled beauty; one which would have
graced the palace-grounds of an emperor. Not a
stump, a root, or tree was visible in all the range of
sight. “God made this clearing,” I remarked. The
charm of silence was broken by the comment, and
the conversation immediately became general.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had ridden about three miles farther, when the
road, if road it could be called, forked suddenly; and,
turning to the left, we found ourselves in front of the
cottage of our host. It deserved this title richly; for
never, in my many journeys beyond the margin of a
regular American forest, have I seen more neatness
and propriety, than was here displayed in all the accidents
of a residence of logs. True! there were
none of those vines and graceful shrubs that beautify
the grounds around a thrifty cottage in New England;
but, even here, a garden was attempted. The building,
two stories in height, stood near the summit of
an acclivity which formed a sort of irregular lawn,
and was actually shaded by two stately trees!—the
only instance of such preservation I have witnessed
in the wilds of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the right, at a decent distance from the house,
were a stable with a loft, and several stacks of hay;
and on the left, a natural meadow, of some ten or
fifteen acres, had been cleared of brush and sedge,
and furnished ample pasturage for four handsome
cows. This, with twelve acres of upland, formed
the extent of the clearing. Several sugar maples
were scattered about the lawn, and a few young
fruit trees ornamented the arable land behind the
house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here, then, was comfort—almost the aristocracy
of the woods! We drove rapidly to the door, but
the sound of wheels had already drawn the family
without the house. The wife, a pale and delicate
woman, about twenty-eight or thirty years of age,
held in one hand, a bare-foot boy of three; while a
little girl, still younger, folded herself in the skirt of
her mother’s woollen frock—her snow-white head,
and light-blue eye peeping out fearfully from her
concealment, as we dismounted. A stout lad, employed
by the farmer, took charge of our horses, and
we were presented to our hostess.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have but poor accommodations to offer the
gentlemen, John! but they are welcome to what we
have, such as they are. You are the first strangers
from the old settlements I have seen since we came
to this clearing! Were you ever in Connecticut?”
Anxiety and hope were most plainly depicted in the
care-worn face of the speaker. I could not bear to
reply in the negative, and evaded the question by
noticing the children as we entered the house. Here,
my companion was surprised at the progress that
had been made in four short years by the labor of a
settler of such slender means. Six decent chairs and
a cherry-wood table ornamented the apartment—a
well-made dough-trough, with a wide and smoothly
planed top, served the purpose of a side-board—a
large cup-board, with curious, home-made wooden
locks and hinges, occupied one corner, and a rude
settee contained, beneath the seat, a tool-chest and a
receptacle for table-linen. The ample fire-place, with
its wooden chimney, was festooned with strings of
venison, hung up to smoke in pieces, and the roughly
plastered wall was ornamented with two rude engravings,
in <span class='it'>domestic</span> frames—Adam and Eve driven
from Paradise, and the victory of Lake Erie. To
these was added a printed copy of the Declaration of
Independence. A Bible stood open upon the table
when we entered, and a prayer-book, Young’s Night
Thoughts, The Lady of the Lake, and a few torn old
numbers of a monthly magazine, adorned a shelf
above the fire. We missed the usual utensils of the
cuisine, but these we afterwards discovered in a more
fitting place. The universal ticking of the wooden
clock was heard; but whence it came, we knew not,
until the hour for retiring. It stood upon the stairway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hanging his rifle and powder-flask on the wooden
hooks, depending, according to custom, from a beam,
our host remarked that we were dusty with travel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tin is scarce with us here, gentlemen! and
crockery is brittle,” said he; “so if you wish to wash
your hands and faces, and will pardon our wild ways,
follow me to the cellar, and you shall be accommodated!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking a coarse but clean towel from the chest in
the settee, he opened a door beneath the stairs, and
descended; leading the way on this singular excursion.
A cellar is a luxury in the simple cabin; but
here we were provided with an apartment more complete,
in its conveniencies, than those of older countries,
the floor being well levelled, and the walls
faced with stones of ample size. The settler had
formed, in one corner, a large cavity about three feet
deep. This was lined with mortar, and paved with
smooth, round pebbles from the brook. A tunnel,
with a wooden trunk and sliding flood-gate, about
four inches square, led from the bottom of this basin,
through the foundations of the wall, to the bed of a
rivulet at some distance on the lawn. The greater
part of the waters of a spring, which rose very near
the house and fed this runnel, being diverted from
their original course, were conveyed through hollow
logs, cleaned out and smoothed by burning, through
the wall of the cellar, about four feet above the floor,
and fell in a beautiful cascade into the basin below.
But our host was far too fertile in resources to permit
the whole of the current to take this direction.
A well made milk-trough, constructed of timbers,
some of which betrayed more intimate acquaintance
with the axe than the plane, occupied nearly the
whole remaining portion of that side of the cellar
which corresponded with the earthen basin. It was
supplied with water by means of a small canal composed
of pieces of bark suspended from the beams
above, and capable of being projected into the cascade,
so as to receive any desirable portion of the
falling fluid. Another tunnel, communicating with
the first, carried off the surplus. As we viewed
these curious results of Yankee ingenuity and perseverance,
several fine speckled trout were seen disporting
among pans or crocks of the richest milk and
cream, into which, we were informed, they sometimes
leaped, to the no small discomforture of the
tidy house-wife, when in their hide-and-whoop gambols,
their daring over-acted their discretion. Here,
then, we found, combined by the most simple means,
the luxury of the washing-room, the drain, the bath,
and the milk-house. Nor was this all! The waters
of a spring, when flowing <span class='it'>pleno rivo</span>, never freeze.
They carry with them, for a time, the heat which is
the expression of the mean temperature of the earth,
and share it with surrounding objects. The very
stream, that thus contributed to his domestic comforts,
and, as we afterwards discovered, rendered, in its
excess, services equally important to his cattle in
the farm-yard, preserved his stock of necessaries
from the effects of frost, and contributed to lessen
the exertions required to procure fuel for the long
and dreary winter. These arrangements rendered
our host still more an object of curiosity and interest—for
seldom had we seen such striking evidences
of philosophical deduction in house-hold affairs:—and
we could not avoid the hope, that the
permanent enjoyment and gradual increase of the
comforts created by his genius, might be his ultimate
reward. But, alas! the prevalent disposition of his
tribe, when once removed from home, is—roving!
Never contented with the <span class='it'>status quo</span>—or satisfied
with possession; they leave the enjoyment of ease
for the hope of wealth, and are ever ready to sacrifice
reality <span class='it'>for a dream</span>. Yet, it was not for <span class='it'>us</span> to
censure our host severely, should he ultimately pursue
the course so admirably described in one short
technicality of the American woods-man—“<span class='it'>Flitting!</span>”
Had we not both been <span class='it'>flitting</span> ourselves!—the
one for honor, and the other for gold! My gown
and my friend’s land were of <span class='it'>equal value</span>, and both
had been purchased at the expense of solid sacrifices;
but little does it concern us now, that the progress of
population has thrown the former over shoulders
well clad in broad-cloth, bought with the surplus of
a decent salary, or that the other is studded with profitable
farms! In many parts of America, twelve
years form an age in human affairs, and, in western
Pennsylvania, <span class='it'>we are of the last</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our ablutions completed, we returned to the sitting-room.
The tea-table was spread with a tidy
cloth, and a smoking pot of Liverpool ware made its
appearance, replete with a beverage, <span class='it'>by the name of
tea</span>; though, by the test of the olfactories, it might
have been supposed some compound discovered
among the ruins of the last Piquot village, in the
days when the venerable Mr. Hooker first raised
the standard of his faith among the ancestors of
her whose hand distilled it.—Peace be with the spirit
of the good old man! Long since our journey, I
have gazed, as a stranger on his venerable tomb-stone
in the central church-yard of Hartford, and felt at
the moment,—it may be with some bitterness—that
the descendants of his flock had lost but little in
frankness and hospitality, by being transplanted to
the Wilds of the west! But <span class='it'>revennons ou nos moutons</span>.<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The table was soon amply furnished with preserves,
in nameless variety, formed from the wild
fruits of the neighbouring woods, by the aid of maple
sugar. The unvarying hard-crusted pie, sweet, well-baked
corn-bread, and the constant attendant of the
lighter meals in New England, the fried potato,
completed the repast. We were seated, and—after
a well-spoken grace—a service which the really respectable
exile of Connecticut rarely neglects in
any of the changing scenes of life—we did it ample
justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Economy of light is a matter of serious importance
in the log-cabin; and after tea, we gathered round
the blazing hearth, (for the autumnal nights were beginning
to be cool,) adding, occasionally, a pine knot
from a group collected in the corner of the fire-place,
by way of illuminating an idea or a face, whenever
the subject-matter of the discourse became peculiarly
interesting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quick and puzzling were the questions with which
our hostess plied us, on all things relating to the “old
settlements,” as she already styled the sea-board;—for
the language and habits of the “far west,” are
still strangely preserved in these mid-land wildernesses,
over which the genius of civilization has
bounded, to wave his omnipotent wand over the
regions of the setting sun, like the last of the mammoths
when he disappeared from the banded hunters
of the olden time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a while, something like the liveliness of earlier
days, stole over the features of the querist, which
were fast settling into the habitual gloom, that gives
character to the physiognomy of the recluse and the
blind. But whatever direction might be given to the
discourse, in a few moments it was sure to centre in
Connecticut; until, evasion proving impracticable,
we were compelled, reluctantly, to confess that our
travels had never extended northward or eastward
of the Housatonic—the American Tweed.—A deep
sigh succeeded this announcement, and our hostess
drew back her chair within the shadow of—what
shall I call it?—<span class='it'>jams</span>, properly so styled, the fire-place
had none! Its sides were formed of short, projecting
logs, about three feet in length, piled, one
above another, interlocking, by deep notches, with
those which formed the walls of the building, at one
end, and at the other, secured by short cross-sections
of a smaller tree, similarly notched, set thwartwise
between their projecting extremities, and bolted with
strong wooden pips. This structure supported the
ample chimney, which was constructed in like manner,
and shared with it the usual protection against
fire, a thick internal coat of clay, admixed with a
very little lime. These chimney sides formed deep
recesses on either hand, in one of which, the cup-board
was accommodated, while the other was
graced by the dining-table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Near to one of these shaded recesses, our hostess
drew her chair, and left the conversation, for a long
time, to her husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He inquired, with an interest, seemingly as intense
as a statesman, into the politics of the East, with the
tenor of which he had contrived to keep pace astonishingly,
when his isolated position is considered. I
was curious to know how he managed to obtain such
accurate information as to men and measures at the
seat of government, in the midst of so many obstacles
and such untiring agricultural efforts as his
rapid improvements must have demanded. His reply
furnished a melancholy proof of the natural disputatiousness
of our species, while it illustrated the pertinacity
with which a mind, once awakened to party
feelings, will cling to its old friendships and antipathies
when all interests in the result have ceased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,” said he, “for a while it was easy enough;
for the Post rides through here once a week, and
leaves a New York paper to Squire Tomkins—so
the winter I first came to these clearings, I used to
walk over to read the paper every other Saturday afternoon,
except when the snow was too deep, and
came back on Sunday after dinner—so I learned
what was going on pretty well. And sometimes one
or other of the old blacksmith’s boys—that’s his
grand-children!—for his two sons have gone off to
Illinois—would come over of odd Saturdays, a
horse-back—for the old soldier kept a horse—he’s
been many years in these parts, and has cleared and
sold three farms, before he fixed where he is—and
he’d take up Mary behind him, and ride over to the
squire’s—for one of us had to stay and tend the
cow and feed the pigs; so we could not both go together—and
bring her back again the next day.—And
a great treat it was to Mary!—for sometimes
she would see something in the paper about Connecticut.—She
used to teach school in Connecticut for
a while.—Poor Mary! she had a better education
than I had—though mine wasn’t a bad one, for a
common school, the way the world goes; and I used
to be able <span class='it'>to say my say</span> with any body; but somehow
these woods are so lonely, that I’m out of practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Mary! her heart’s in Connecticut still,
though she never tells me so,—<span class='it'>but she looks it sometimes</span>—except
may-be about Thanks-giving day,—and
then she can’t help <span class='it'>saying it</span> too! I’m sometimes
a’most sorry she ever married such a wild and wandering
fellow as me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, John!”—in a tone of the tenderest expostulation,
sounded from the corner. Almost unconsciously,
I threw a pine knot on the fire, and the
sudden flame lighted up a countenance, which would
have reassured the most desponding husband. All
traces of the inanity of solitude were gone; and over
the cloud of sorrow, in which early recollections had
veiled the features,—even while the tears of memory
were starting from the eye,—the moon-beam of
unalterable love poured its silvery light, and the pride
of the wife spoke plainly in the curve of a lip already
raised and trembling with affectionate reproach.
The moisture lingered threateningly upon the lids,
but did not fall!—It paused a moment, as in doubt,
what emotion called it there, and then retreated to
its source.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The husband’s face was wreathed in smiles; his
voice became firmer; his language lost its parenthetic
confusion on the instant, and he resumed his discourse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well! well! It’s all my fault, if fault there be.
<span class='it'>She</span> never had a fault! and she’s a blessing that would
pay for twenty thousand faults of mine! There, Mary!
Put the little ones to bed in the loft, and hear them
say their prayers.” He dismissed them with a parting
kiss, and when his wife retired—continued his
narrative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The squire and I were friends, all through the
winter and spring. He and his two sons, with the
blacksmith’s boys, and three men from the furnace
ten miles down the stream, assisted me to build my
house; and I borrowed a horse from the smith and a
wagon in town, to bring my lime for the plastering;
so, when my new house was finished, we turned the
old one, that I told you of as we came along, into a
right good stable. I had laid up a full supply of provisions
in the old house, the fall before,—bought me
a plough and some tools,—felled a good deal of valuable
pine timber, and put the four acres of clearing
into winter grain. With the first spring-floods, I
floated the pines, by the help of the squire’s oxen,
and carried enough down to the saw-mill, (it’s only
twelve miles,) to bring me a good round sum; and
then I had money enough to pay my first instalment,
buy me another cow and a pair of oxen, and pay my
way till harvest, without draining all the savings I
brought out with me. In the winter, I had also got
three acres girdled, and the meadow half cleared; for
it wanted but little attention; so, as my potatoes
turned out uncommon well, and every thing prospered—I
bought me a horse and wagon in the fall, and
saved just enough to pay the second instalment;—trusting
to Providence <span class='it'>and the stores</span> for the little
we should want to buy next season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But this is not what I was talking of—I had like
to have forgot the squire!—We got along very well
till June or July—when we were mowing the meadow.—Yes!
it was in July.—And the squire was
a churchman and a democrat, but I was a federalist
and a congregationalist—I did not much mind his
jokes about the pilgrim fathers, though he said the
Piquots were better men than those that planted
the state; and laughed at them for hanging the Quakers
in Boston. For the squire was a well read man
before he came to the west—and he hated Connecticut,
because he came from Lancaster county, and
his father was killed in a quarrel with the settlers in
Wyoming, long after the troubles were over. But
when he said that Jefferson was a better man than
General Washington, I could not stand it, and we
quarrelled. I said what no Christian should say, and
what I wont repeat;—so the squire and I have never
spoken since, except when poor Mary was taken
down! and then I had to speak; for there was no
other woman within ten miles, and no doctor but a
quack, within twenty-five. But Mrs. Tomkins is a
nurse and a doctor both—God bless her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m getting to be very comfortable now, for I’ve
got every thing around me that a man can desire in
the woods, except money; and I’ve little use for that
except to pay the last instalment; but I can’t bear to
keep that woman so lonely and sad for want of company!
The old soldier’s daughter comes over to see
us once a month; but that is little for one who used
to have a dozen young friends always around her in
Connecticut, even if she was poor. To tell the truth,
though the woods are full of venison and wild turkies,
and quails and squirrels to be had for the shooting,
and though Tom can catch a mess of trout in the
milk trough at any time,—for he lets his line run into
the tunnel and there seems to be no end to them—yet
I can’t help thinking that if I had laid out my
three hundred dollars of hers and my savings in old
Connecticut—if I had worked half as hard there as
I have done here, and she had gone on teaching
school, we should both have been happier and richer
than we are now. So I think I shall soon pull up
stakes, sell out, and go to the prairies, where God
makes the clearings, as you said, on the road—and
it’s real hard work for a man, I can tell you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This last remark threw me into a revery of no
pleasing nature; and I, in turn, retreated into the
shade, as the light of the pine-knot subsided and the

<p class='pindent'>There was much conversation afterwards; and at
intervals I gleaned the strong points of his history,
and that of her whose fate he now controlled. But
I was busy with my dream! Peering into the far off
future, I saw him in the last of his <span class='it'>flittings</span>!—deserted
by those who should be the props of his age,
but whose youthful fire would not permit them to
remain inactive in the wilderness, after pictures
of eastern wealth and luxury, clad in all the glorious
hues of memory, had been rendered familiar as nursery
tales by their suicidal parents. I saw him in
the evening of his days—and where?—seated by his
feeble and exhausted, though still affectionate partner,
at the door of an ill-provided cabin, far in the
north-west—Far beyond the present range of the
pioneer! The gloom of night was slowly dropping
its curtain around them, though the phosphorescent
snow gave dim illumination to the broad and trackless
expanse of the prairie—trackless then, even by
the exterminated Buffalo. <span class='it'>There</span> were none even
of the few conveniences of his present wood-land
home; for the genius and the skill which had once
enabled him to bend the stubborn gifts of nature to
his will, were chilled by the frosts of age.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could even hear the voices of future years stealing
on the autumnal night breeze, as it moaned
through the rough and ill-joined casement where we
sat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, John, this is Thanks-giving night! Where
can our oldest boy be wandering now? He was just
thirty yesterday, and we have not heard from him
these six years!—Not since you made your last flitting,
John! He was always a good boy, and I’m
sure he has written to us! John! you may depend
upon it, there must be a letter in the office at St.
Louis—St. Louis, was it? or was it Chicago? My
memory begins to fail me so! He sent us fifty dollars
the last time, when we lived in Wisconsin, away
down in the States. It must have been in Chicago;
for it was there he wrote before!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Mary! Mary! boys forget their mothers and
their fathers too, when they are old and feeble! He
is getting rich somewhere far over yonder, and little
he thinks of us! But there’s little Mary, where can
she be? Her husband was just gone to New Orleans
with a load of furs when the hunters went down to
the bluffs in the fall, and they sent our letter after
them—but may-be she never got it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, it’s Thanks-giving night, Mary! and if I had
loved the graves of my parents as I ought, we should
not be here, where our children that are away will
never find our own. Well, well! I’m too old to hunt,
and if the trapping turns out no better than it did last
year, we’ll have our next Thanks-giving, Mary,
where there will be no end to it! and sure you have
earned the <span class='it'>right</span> to be at rest, by your faithfulness,
however it may go with me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While this picture was floating through my mind,
I had learned from occasional sentences, that our
host was the son of parents of respectability; but
his father had foolishly left the agricultural life,
which he understood and was pursuing prosperously,
for cities and merchandize, for which he had no
talent. He died a bankrupt, leaving one son at the age
of eight years and a daughter of eighteen. The latter
had been affianced, during her father’s prosperity,
to the son of a man of wealth; but that wealth had
been the result of the closest selfishness in early
life. As usual, the native vulgarity of feeling and
heartlessness of character which had caused his unwonted
and undeserved pecuniary success, remained
unchanged in the days of his spurious social elevation.
He forbade the further visits of his son the moment
the disaster of the parent of his intended wife
was known. He forbade it suddenly and without a
warning. The consequences were such as are
almost too frequent to attract attention. A lovely
woman pined a few years over the ill-requited needle,
and died “in a decline.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A young man about town” looked sad for a few
months, and then married an heiress to extend the
curse of hereditary meanness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the little village where our host was reared, by
a near relative in the original occupation of his father,
he formed his attachment to his present companion:
She was then a teacher, starving upon the <span class='it'>liberal</span>
salary that rewards the principal of a female common
school in “the State where education is universal.”
To marry at home would have required sacrifices of
conventional rank on the part of his intended, to
which his pride would not suffer him to reduce her;
for how could he ask her to share the fortunes of a
laborer in the field? To wait until their united efforts
would enable them to secure a farm, was more than
his impatience could endure. In evil hour a bright
dream of the west had thrown him into the wilderness,
and rendered him dependent upon the accidents
of sun and rain for protection against the tender
mercies of a Land Company—which calculated upon
the profits of indiscretion and extended credit willingly,
while accepting actual payment with regret. His
energies might probably bear him through his trials,
could he be contented to avoid expansion until the
flood-tide of civilization might have time to reach
his retreat, but already he was restless, and his eyes
were directed to the fatal west—and it appeared
painfully probable that a few short years would find
him again dependent on his axe, or a prey to larger
speculations in a deeper wilderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We soon retired to our comfortable cat-tail beds,
by the light of a domestic candle, regretting that our
kind entertainers refused us the extempore lodging
on the floor to which, in true woodland courtesy,
they condemned themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was long before sleep relieved the unpleasant
thoughts awakened by the conversation of the evening.
My mind wandered over many a tale of the
woods, in which blighted hopes and ruined prospects
constituted the prominent features. True, I had
seen much of happiness in similar situations,—for
Providence has constructed some one of the human
family peculiarly fitted to occupy each niche in the
great temple of society,—but how frequently the
abuse of the inestimable privilege of <span class='it'>free will</span> renders
it a curse instead of a blessing. I sometimes
think that the exceptions constitute the rule, and that
a small minority only ever accomplish the destiny
for which they were created. Jarring, confusion,
and disorder mark every page of nature,—every
paragraph of history! Here was a man of spirit,
enterprise, energy, and talent, who had fled from the
only field where happiness was proffered at a slight
expense of pride, to waste his powers upon a wilderness
for the benefit, in all probability, of certain
merchants and capitalists in Holland. He dragged
down with him an amiable being who was fitted by
her moral excellencies, and even by her education,
humble as it may have been, for a far wider sphere
of usefulness; and why? Because he could not bear
to ask a fond and loving woman to descend to a station
which she would have gloried to share with
him!</p>

<p class='pindent'>How little men know of the true character of the
self-sacrificing sex, until the frosts of old age begin
to crown their venerable fronts, and they find their
knowledge useless!</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is said that there is but one step from the sublime
to the ridiculous; but, although legend upon legend
crowded on my memory, the pathetic had still the
ascendancy, and I entertained my companion with
stories, not all of which were colored in rain-bow
hues, until the moon-light deserted the casement, and
the fatigue of nearly forty miles of travel enabled us
to sink into repose. As one of these recollections is
pertinent to the occasion, and illustrative of life in
the woods, it may not be amiss to offer it to the reader.
It furnishes an instance of indiscretion which,
could the effect have been foreseen, would be
esteemed an act of cruelty worthy of the worst
days of the inquisition. And yet it was perpetrated by
a female—by one who should have known the peculiarities
of her sex!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our highly intelligent friend, Mc——,” said I,
“has resided for some years in the town of ——,
and has become familiar with the independent life
of a western village. She owns a considerable tract
of wild land on the New York border, and, as her
husband’s eccentricities (for he is an American Old
Mortality) are equal with his fame and classical acquirements,
she thought it best to proceed by herself,
on horse-back, to visit the property and examine its
resources. After journeying for several days by
every stages and frequented routes, she took an appropriate
path and plunged into the forest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After much difficulty and fatigue, she arrived at
the cabin of a squatter, which she knew to have been
<span class='it'>located</span> for many years on or near her line. The
visit of the owner was not unsafe, for the man was
a bee-hunter, trapper, and timber thief of the most
gentle manners, and utterly despised all efforts at
clearing beyond the acre. His pigs—his only stock—ran
wild in the woods, and he cared nothing for
real estate so long as there were trees left for a deer-cover,
timber to be stolen, bees to be limed, and a
bounty for wolves. He looked upon a new settlement
as only another market and prowling ground,
incommoding him in nothing, and likely to increase
the dainties of his larder by an occasional chicken
and eggs. He lived for the <span class='it'>present</span>—dreamed neither
of the <span class='it'>past</span> nor the <span class='it'>future</span>—and nothing but habitual
laziness prevented him from being perpetually peripatetic.
He was absent from home when Mrs. —— arrived,
and she was received with back-woods hospitality
by his wife;—for even this creature, whose
only beverage was “Le vin ordinaire de ce pays
ci—un liqueur abominable qu’on appelle <span class='it'>Ouiskey</span>!”
actually had a wife, and an affectionate one, who
had resided on or near the spot since the days of Jefferson!
After a comfortable night of repose upon a
bundle of dried leaves, in her riding suit, Mrs. ——
arose, and made preparations <span class='it'>for viewing the property</span>.
No lady neglects the toilet, even in the most
distressing circumstances. I have several times
heard death preferred to the loss of a fine head of
hair, in the wards of a hospital, and it is not to be
supposed that Mrs. R. was unprovided with a looking-glass.
She proceeded to withdraw the several appurtenances
of the dressing-room from her well-stored
portmanteau, narrowly and wonderingly watched by
her kind hostess. But the instant the mirror appeared,
the lonely denizen of the wilds exclaimed, with startling
energy—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! dear Mrs. R.! That’s a looking-glass! Do
let me look in it! I have not seen my face plainly
for thirty years! I go down to the spring sometimes
and try to see myself; but the water is so rough that
it don’t look at all like me! Do let me look at it!
Do now!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The glass was handed to the delighted woman.
She cast but one glance upon it. The mirror fell in
fragments on the floor, the unfortunate creature
fainted and fell back on the rude bench behind her,
and Mrs. R. visited her ample domain, that day, with
a head half combed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The very early breakfast the next morning was a
cheerful one. When it was completed, we rode
over by the squire’s, with our host for a guide, and
after proceeding about three miles into the woods,
tied our horses at the termination of all signs of road,
and advanced on foot. We soon separated, the merchant
and the farmer to estimate the chances of water-power,
iron beds, timber, and lime-quarries, and
I, with my host’s rifle, a paper of pins, a botanical
box, and a pocket insect net, to my favorite pursuits.
We agreed to rendezvous at the place of parting
when the hour of three arrived; and, being all
familiar with the art of navigating the forest, there
was no danger of a failure in meeting the engagement.
When we returned from our excursions, and
I observed the disappointed look of my Athenian
friend, I felt myself the richer, notwithstanding he
styled himself possessor of five thousand acres, and
I bore upon my shield the footless birds of a younger
son; for my hat was serried with glittering insects,
impaled upon its crown and sides; my box was
stored with rarities, and, on a hickory pole across
my shoulder, hung a great horned owl, a hawk,
twelve headless black squirrels, and a Canada porcupine!</p>

<p class='pindent'>We stopped at the squire’s for a dinner; and,
strange to say, succeeded in inducing our host to bear
us company, despite his political aversions; so that
we have reason to believe that our visit was successful
in settling a feud which had seriously curtailed
the comforts of both parties for nearly three long
years. As we were rambling over the ground,
while our meal was in preparation, our attention was
called to a tamed marmot or ground hog, that had
been a favorite of the family during several years.
He had just commenced burrowing a residence for
his long months of hybernation—for the coolness of
the nights forewarned him that the period of activity
was nearly over. By the orchard fence, upon a little
mound commanding a broad view of the squire’s
improvements, he sat upright on the grass, by the
side of the yellow circle of dust which his labors
already rendered sufficiently conspicuous. The sun
obliquely shed a milder and more contemplative
light over a scene softened by the autumnal haze.
The foliage wore the serious depth of green which
precedes the change of the leaf, and, on the higher
ground, small patches of yellow, red and brown began
to vary the uniformity of the forest. He sat
with his fore-paws gently crossed upon his bosom,
like an old man reposing at evening by the door of
his cottage, calmly and peacefully reflecting that the
labors of life were drawing to a close. The autumn
wind soughed by, with a premonitory moan, and our
philosophic friend threw up one ear to drink the
ominous sound, shook his head, as it died away,
with an obvious shudder, as though some chilly dream
of winter disturbed his repose, and turning slowly
round, commenced digging deliberately at his burrow.
In a few minutes he reappeared and seemed again
buried in contemplating the beauty of the scenery.
Ere long another and a stronger blast swept through
the trees, with a more threatening voice—bearing
upon its wings a few withered leaves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of these fell close to the person of the marmot.
The intimation was not to be mistaken. He
gently descended to the horizontal attitude, crawled
towards the unwelcome courier of decay, applied
his nose to it for a moment, then, wheeling rapidly
round, plunged suddenly into his hole and sent the
dirt flying into the air by the rapid action of his fore-paws.
I turned to the Exile of Connecticut, who
had also watched this interesting scene, and remarked:
“You propose to go to the prairies! It is
summer with you yet, but I see that the leaves are
beginning to turn: there are a few grey hairs gathering
about your brow. Is it not time to choose your
last resting place? to dig your last burrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt the force of the query, and remained in
thought for several minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If it were not for the next instalment, I think I
should stay where I am till the neighborhood could
grow up around us, and Mary could go to church
and little John to school. But—I don’t know!—I
think I shall have to sell out and <span class='it'>flit</span> in the spring, if
I could find a purchaser! I’m young yet; and that
little beast did not throw the dirt so high in the
spring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor fellow! I hear that the ground reverted to
the company two years afterwards; but whether he
sold out and <span class='it'>flitted</span> with a full purse, or started on
foot with his Mary and the children, and an axe on
his shoulder, I have never heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>There</span> were merriment and music in the Chateau
des Tournelles—at that time the abode of France’s
Royalty!—Music and merriment, even from the
break of day! That was a singular age—an age
of great transitions. The splendid spirit-stirring
soul of chivalry was alive yet among the nations—<span class='it'>yet</span>!
although fast declining, and destined soon to
meet its death blow in the spear thrust that hurled
the noble Henry, last victim of its wondrous system,
at once from saddle and from throne!—In every art,
in every usage, new science had effected even then
mighty changes; yet it was the <span class='sc'>old world still</span>!
Gunpowder, and the use of musquetry and ordnance,
had introduced new topics; yet still knights spurred
their barbed chargers to the shock, still rode in complete
steel—and tilts and tournaments still mustered
all the knightly and the noble; and banquets at high
noon, and balls in the broad day-light, assembled to
the board or to the dance, the young, the beautiful,
and happy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were merriment and music in the court—the
hall—the stair-case—the saloons of state! All
that France held of beautiful, and bright, and brave,
and wise, and noble, were gathered to the presence
of their King.—And there were many there, well
known and honored in those olden days; well known
and honored ever after!—The first, in person as in
place, was the great King!—the proud and chivalrous
and princely!—becoming his high station at all
times and in every place—wearing his state right
gracefully and freely—the second Henry!—and at
his side young Francis, the King-Dauphin; with her,
the cynosure of every heart, the star of that fair
company—Scotland’s unrivalled Mary hanging upon
his manly arm, and gazing up with those soft, dove-like
eyes, fraught with unutterable soul, into her
husband’s face—into her husband’s spirit.—Brissac
was there, and Joyeuse, and Nevers; and Jarnac,
the renowned for skill in fence, and Vielleville; and
the Cardinal Lorraine, and all the glorious Guises,—and
Montmorenci, soon to be famous as the slayer of
his King, and every peer of France, and every peerless
lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Loud pealed the exulting symphonies; loud sang
the chosen minstrelsy—and as the gorgeous sun-beams
rushed in a flood of tinted lustre through the
rich many-colored panes of the tall windows, glancing
on soft voluptuous forms and eyes that might out-dazzle
their own radiance, arrayed in all the pomp
and pride of that magnificent and stately period—a
more resplendent scene could scarcely be imagined.
That was a day of rich and graceful costumes, when
men and warriors thought it no shame to be adorned
in silks and velvets, with chains of goldsmith’s work
about their necks, and jewels in their ears, and on
their hatbands, buttons, and buckles, and sword-hilts;
and if such were the sumptuous attire of the sterner
and more solid sex, what must have been the ornature
of the court ladies, under the gentle sway of
such a being as Diane de Poitiers, the lovely mistress
of the monarch, and arbitress of the soft follies
of the Court?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The palace halls were decked with every fanciful
variety, some in the pomp of blazoned tapestries
with banners rustling from the cornices above the
jocund dancers, some filled with fresh green branches,
wrought into silver arbors, sweet garlands perfuming
the air, and the light half excluded or tempered
into a mild and emerald radiance by the dense foliage
of the rare exotics. Pages and ushers tripped
it to and fro, clad in the royal liveries, embroidered
with the cognizance of Henry, the fuigist salamander,
bearing the choicest wines, the rarest cates, in
every interval of the resounding dance.—It would
be tedious to dwell longer on the scene; to multiply
more instances of the strange mixture, which might
be witnessed everywhere, of artificial luxury with
semibarbarous rudeness—to specify the graces of
the company, the beauty of the demoiselles and
dames, the stately bearing of the warrior nobles, as
they swept back and forth in the quaint mazes of
some antiquated measure, were a task to be undertaken
only by some old chronicler, with style as curious
and as quaint as the manners he portrays in
living colors.—Enough for us to catch a fleeting
glimpse of the grand pageantry! to sketch with a
dashy pencil the groups which he would designate
with absolute and accurate minuteness!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But there was one among that gay assemblage, who
must not be passed over with so slight a regard, since
she attracted on that festive day, as much of wondering
admiration for her unequalled beauties as she excited
grief, and sympathy, and fear, in after days, for
her sad fortunes,—but there was now no cloud upon
her radiant beauty, no dimness prophetic of approaching
tears in her large laughing eyes, no touch
of melancholy thought upon one glorious feature—Marguerite
de Vaudreuil, the heiress of a ducal fortune,
the heiress of charms so surpassing, that rank
and fortune were forgotten by all who gazed upon
her pure high brow, her dazzling glances, her seductive
smile, the perfect symmetry of her whole shape
and person! Her hair, of the darkest auburn shade,
fell in a thousand ringlets, glittering out like threads
of virgin gold when a stray sunbeam touched them,
fell down her snowy neck over the shapely shoulders
and so much of a soft heaving bosom—veined
by unnumbered azure channels, wherein the pure
blood coursed so joyously—as was displayed by the
falling laces which decked her velvet boddice—her
eyes, so quick and dazzling was their light, almost
defied description, possessing at one time the depth
and brilliance of the black, melting into the softer
languor of the blue—yet they were of the latter
hue, and suited truly to the whole style and
character of her voluptuous beauty. Her form, as
has been noticed, was symmetry itself; and every
movement, every step, was fraught with natural and
unstudied grace.—In sooth, she seemed almost too
beautiful for mere mortality—and so thought many
an one who gazed upon her, half drunk with that
divine delirium which steeps the souls of men who
dwell too steadfastly upon such wondrous charms,
as she bounded through the labyrinth of the dance,
lighter and springier than the world-famed gazelle,
or rested from the exciting toil in panting abandonment
upon some cushioned settle! and many inquired
of themselves, could it be possible that an exterior so
divine should be the tenement of a harsh worldly spirit—that
a demeanor and an air so frank, so cordial, and
so warm, should be but the deceptive veil that hid a
selfish, cold, bad heart. Aye! many asked themselves
that question on that day, but not one answered
his own question candidly or truly—no! not one
man!—for in her presence he had been more or less
than mortal, who could pronounce his sentence unmoved
by the attractions of her outward seeming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For Marguerite de Vaudreuil had been but three
short months before affianced as the bride of the
young Baron de La-Hirè—the bravest and best of
Henry’s youthful nobles. It had been a love treaty—no
matter of shrewd bartering of hearts—no cold
and worldly convenance—but the outpouring, as it
seemed, of two young spirits, each warm and worthy
of the other!—and men had envied him, and
ladies had held her more fortunate in her high conquest,
than in her rank, her riches, or her beauties;
and the world had forgotten to calumniate, or to
sneer, in admiration of the young glorious pair, that
seemed so fitly mated. Three little months had
passed—three more, and they had been made one!—but,
in the interval, Charles de La-Hirè, obedient to
his King’s behest, had buckled on his sword, and led
the followers of his house to the Italian wars. With
him, scarcely less brave, and, as some thought, yet
handsomer than he, forth rode upon his first campaign,
Armand de Laguy, his own orphaned cousin,
bred like a brother on his father’s hearth; and, as
Charles well believed, a brother in affection. Three
little months had passed, and in a temporary truce,
Armand de Laguy had returned alone, leading the
relics of his cousin’s force, and laden with the doleful
tidings of that cousin’s fall upon the field of
honor. None else had seen him die, none else had
pierced so deeply into the hostile ranks; but Armand
had rushed madly on to save his noble kinsman, and
failing in the desperate attempt, had borne off his reward
in many a perilous wound. Another month,
and it was whispered far and near, that Marguerite
had dried her tears already; and that Armand de
Laguy had, by his cousin’s death, succeeded, not to
lands and to lordships only, but to the winning of that
dead cousin’s bride.—It had been whispered far and
near—and now the whisper was proved true. For,
on this festive day, young Armand, still pale from
the effects of his exhausting wounds, and languid
from loss of the blood, appeared in public for the first
time, not in the sable weeds of decent and accustomed
wo, but in the gayest garb of a successful
bridegroom—his pourpoint of rose-colored velvet
strewn thickly with seed pearl and broideries of
silver, his hose of rich white silk, all slashed and
lined with cloth of silver, his injured arm suspended
in a rare scarf of the lady’s colors, and, above all, the
air of quiet confident success with which he offered,
and that lovely girl received, his intimate attentions,
showed that for once, at least, the tongue of rumor
had told truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore men gazed in wonder—and marvelled
as they gazed, and half condemned!—yet they who
had been loudest in their censure when the first
whisper reached their ears of so disloyal love, of so
bold-fronted an inconstancy, now found themselves
devising many an excuse within their secret hearts
for this sad lapse of one so exquisitely fair. Henry
himself had frowned, when Armand de Laguy led
forth the fair betrothed, radiant in festive garb and
decked with joyous smiles—but the stern brow of
the offended prince had smoothed itself into a softer
aspect, and the rebuff which he had determined—but
a second’s space before—to give to the untimely
lovers, was frittered down into a jest before it left
the lips of the repentant speaker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day was well-nigh spent—the evening banquet
had been spread, and had been honored, duly—and
now the lamps were lit in hall, and corridor, and
bower; and merrier waxed the mirth, and faster
wheeled the dance. The company were scattered
to and fro, some wandering in the royal gardens,
which overspread at that day, most of the Isle de
Paris; some played with cards or dice; some drank
and revelled in the halls; some danced unwearied in
the grand saloons; some whispered love in ladies’
ears in dark sequestered bowers—and of these last
were Marguerite and Armand—a long alcove of
thick green boughs, with orange trees between,
flowering in marble vases, and myrtles, and a thousand
odorous trees mingling their perfumed shadows, led
to a lonely bower—and there alone in the dim star-light—alone
indeed! for they might now be deemed
as one, sat the two lovers. One fair hand of the frail
lady was clasped in the bold suitor’s right—while
his left arm, unconscious of its wound, was twined
about her slender waist; her head reclined upon his
shoulder, with all its rich redundancy of ringlets
floating about his neck and bosom, and her eyes, languid
and suffused, fondly turned up to meet his passionate
glances. “And can it be”—he said, in the
thick broken tones that tell of vehement passion—“And
can it be that you indeed love Armand?—I
fear, I fear, sweet beauty, that I, like Charles, should
be forgotten, were I, like Charles, removed—for
him thou didst love dearly—while on me never
didst thou waste thought or word.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Him—never, Armand, never!—by the bright
stars above us—by the great gods that hear us—I
never—never <span class='it'>did</span> love Charles de La-Hirè—never
did love man, save thee, my noble Armand.—False
girlish vanity and pique led me to toy with him at
first; now to my sorrow I confess it—and when
thou didst look coldly upon me, and seem’dst to woo
dark Adeline de Courcy, a woman’s vengeance stirred
up my very soul, and therefore to punish thee,
whom only did I love, I well nigh yielded up myself
to torture by wedding one whom I esteemed indeed
and honored—but never thought of for one moment
with affection—wilt thou believe me, Armand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sweet Angel, Marguerite!” and he clasped her
to his hot heaving breast, and her white arms were
flung about his neck, and their lips met in a long
fiery kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just in that point of time—in that soft melting
moment—a heavy hand was laid quietly on Armand’s
shoulder—he started, as the fiend sprang up, revealed
before the temper of Ithuriel’s angel weapon—he
started like a guilty thing from that forbidden
kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A tall form stood beside him, shrouded from head
to heel in a dark riding cloak of the Italian fashion;
but there was no hat on the stately head, nor any
covering to the cold stern impassive features. The
high broad forehead as pale as sculptured marble,
with the dark chestnut curls falling off parted evenly
upon the crown—the full, fixed, steady eye, which
he could no more meet than he could gaze unscathed
on the meridian sun, the noble features, sharpened
by want and suffering and wo—were all! all those
of his good cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment’s space the three stood there in silence!—Charles
de La-Hirè reaping rich vengeance
from the unconquerable consternation of the traitor!
Armand de Laguy bent almost to the earth with
shame and conscious terror! and Marguerite half
dead with fear, and scarcely certain if indeed he who
stood before her were the man in his living presence,
whom she had vowed to love for ever; or if it were
but the visioned form of an indignant friend returned
from the dark grave to thunderstrike the false disturbers
of his eternal rest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am in time”—he said at length, in accents
slow and unfaltering, as his whole air was cold and
tranquil—“in time to break off this monstrous union!—Thy
perjuries have been in vain, weak man;
thy lies are open to the day.—He whom thou didst
betray to the Italian’s dungeon—to the Italian’s dagger—as
thou didst then believe and hope—stands
bodily before thee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A long heart-piercing shriek burst from the lips of
Marguerite, as the dread import of his speech fell
on her sharpened ears—the man whom she <span class='it'>had</span>
loved—<span class='it'>first</span> loved!—for all her previous words were
false and fickle—stood at her side in all his power
and glory—and she affianced to a liar, a base traitor—a
foul murderer in his heart!—a scorn and by-word
to her own sex—an object of contempt and
hatred to every noble spirit!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at that instant Armand de Laguy’s pride
awoke—for he <span class='it'>was</span> proud, and brave, and daring!—and
he gave back the lie, and hurled defiance in his
accuser’s teeth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Death to thy soul!” he cried—“ ’tis thou that
lieth!—Charles!—did I not see thee stretched on
the bloody plain? did I not sink beside thee, hewed
down and trampled under foot, in striving to preserve
thee?—and when my vassals found me, wert thou
not beside me—with thy face scarred, indeed, and
mangled beyond recognition, but with the surcoat and
the arms upon the lifeless corpse, and the sword in
the cold hand?—’Tis thou that liest, man!—’tis
thou that, for some base end, didst conceal thy life;
and now wouldst charge thy felonies on me—but
’twill not do—fair cousin.—The King shall judge
between us!—Come lady”—and he would have
taken her by the hand, but she sprang back as though
a viper would have stung her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back traitor!—” she exclaimed, in tones of the
deepest loathing.—“I hate thee, spit on thee! defy
thee!—Base have I been myself, and frail, and
fickle—but, as I live, Charles de La-Hirè—but as I
live <span class='it'>now</span>, and <span class='it'>will</span> die right shortly—I knew not of
this villany! I did believe thee dead, as that false
murtherer swore—and—God be good to me!—I
did betray thee dead; and now have lost thee living!
But for thee, Armand de Laguy, dog! traitor! villain!
knave!—dare not to look upon me any more;
dare not address me with one accent of thy serpent
tongue! for Marguerite de Vaudreuil, fallen although
she be, and lost for ever, is not so all abandoned
as, knowing thee for what thou art, to bear
with thee one second longer—no! not though that
second could redeem all the past—and wipe out all
the sin!—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fine words! Fine words, fair mistress!—but
on with me thou shalt!” and he stretched out his
arm to seize her, when, with a perfect majesty,
Charles de La-Hirè stepped in and grasped him by
the wrist, and held him for a moment there, gazing
into his eye as though he would have read his soul;
then threw him off with force, that made him stagger
back ten paces before he could regain his footing!—then!
then! with all the fury of the fiend
depicted on his working lineaments, Armand unsheathed
his rapier and made a full lunge, bounding
forwards as he did so, right at his cousin’s heart! but
he was foiled again, for with a single, and, as it
seemed, slight motion of the sheathed broadsword,
which he held under his cloak, Charles de La-Hirè
struck up the weapon, and sent it whirling through
the air to twenty paces distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then there came a shout “the King! the
King!”—and, with the words, a glare of many
torches, and, with his courtiers and his guard about
him, the Monarch stood forth in offended majesty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ha!—what means this insolent broil?—What
men be these who dare draw swords within the palace
precincts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>My</span> sword is sheathed, sire,” answered De La-Hirè,
kneeling before the King and laying the good
weapon at his feet—“nor has been ever drawn,
save at your highness’ bidding, against your highness’
foes!—But I beseech you, sire, as you love
honesty and honor, and hate deceit and treason, grant
me your royal license to prove Armand de Laguy,
recreant, base, and traitorous, a liar and a felon, and
a murtherer, hand to hand, in the presence of the
ladies of your court, according to the law of arms
and honor!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something of this we have heard already”—replied
the King, “Baron de La-Hirè!—But say out
now, of what accuse you Armand de Laguy?—shew
but good cause, and thy request is granted; for I
have not forgot your good deeds in my cause against
our rebel Savoyards and our Italian foemen—of
what accuse you Armand de Laguy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That he betrayed me wounded into the hands of
the Duke of Parma! that he dealt with Italian bravoes
to compass my assassination! that by foul
lies and treacherous devices, he has trained from me
my affianced bride: and last, not least, deprived her
of fair name and honor.—This will I prove upon his
body, so help me God and my good sword.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand forth and answer to his charge De Laguy—speak
out! what sayest thou?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I say,” answered Armand boldly—“I say
that he lies!—that he did feign his own death
for some evil ends!—and did deceive me, who
would have died to succor him!—That I, believing
him dead, have won from him the love of this fair
lady, I admit.—But I assert that I did win it fairly,
and of good right!—And for the rest, I say he lies
doubly, when he asserts that she has lost fair
name, or honor—this is <span class='it'>my</span> answer, sire; and I beseech
you grant <span class='it'>his</span> prayer, and let us prove our
words, as gentlemen of France and soldiers, forthwith,
by singular battle!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amen!” replied the King—“the third day hence
at noon, in the tilt yard, before our court, we do
adjudge the combat—and this fair lady be the prize
of the victor!—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! sire,” interposed Charles de La-Hirè, again
kneeling—but before he had the time to add a second
word, Marguerite de Vaudreuil, who had stood all
the while with her hands clasped and her eyes rivetted
upon the ground, sprung forth with a great cry—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No! no! for God-sake! no! no! sire—great
King—good gentleman—brave knight! doom me
not to a fate so dreadful.—Charles de La-Hirè is all
that man can be, of good, or great, or noble! but I
betrayed him, whom I deemed dead; and he can
never trust me living!—Moreover, if he would take
me to his arms, base as I am and most false hearted,
he should not—for God forbid that <span class='it'>my</span> dishonor
should blight <span class='it'>his</span> noble fame.—As for the slave De
Laguy—the traitor and low liar, doom me, great
monarch, to the convent or the block—but curse me
not with such contamination!—For, by the heavens
I swear! and by the God that rules them! that I
will die by my own hand, before I wed that serpent!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Be it so, fair one,” answered the King very
coldly—“be it so! we permit thy choice—a convent
or the victor’s bridal bed shall be thy doom, at
thine own option!—Meanwhile your swords, sirs;
until the hour of battle ye are both under our arrest.
Jarnac be thou Godfather to Charles de La-Hirè!—Nevers,
do thou like office for de Laguy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By God! not I, sire;” answered the proud
duke. “I hold this man’s offence so rank, his guilt
so palpable, that, on my conscience! I think your
royal hangman were his best Godfather!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nevertheless, De Nevers—it shall be, as I say!—this
bold protest of thine is all sufficient for thine
honor—and it is but a form!—no words, duke! it
must be as I have said!—Joyeuse, escort this lady
to thy duchess—pray her accept of her as the King’s
guest, until this matter be decided. The third day
hence at noon, on foot, with sword and dagger—with
no arms of defence or vantage—the principals
to fight alone, until one die or yield—and so God
shield the right!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>I was</span> sitting the other afternoon before my library
fire, listening to the fitful breeze without that swayed
the trees to and fro before the house and moaned
down in the neighbouring woods, when I suddenly
recollected that the last sheets of “The Reefer” had
gone to press a fortnight before, and that, consequently,
my career of authorship was closed. The
idea, I confess, gave me pleasure, for I am by nature
an indolent man, and would at any time rather dream
by a cheery fire, with my slippered feet reposing on
my tiger-skin rug, than tie myself down to a writing-table,
even though it be to record my own or my
friends’ adventures, and “go about the world from
hand to hand.” I am not ambitious. I prefer ease
to reputation, quiet to turmoil, the epicurean to all
other philosophy. To read my favorite authors; to
indulge in reveries at the twilight hour; to gaze on
fine pictures, choice statues, and tasteful rooms; to
listen to the melting airs of Burns, or the glorious
hallelujahs of Handel; to sport on my own grounds
on a clear, bracing morning; to gallop over the wild
hills and through the romantic valleys which surround
my residence;—these are the enjoyments in which
I delight, and which I prefer to all the reputation
either the pen or the sword can give. Others may
choose a more bustling life; but I have had my share
of that! Give me a quiet, happy home, for there only
is true happiness to be found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Musing thus, I was unconscious of the entrance of
an intruder, until I heard a slight cough beside me,
and looking up, I saw my faithful servant John standing
over my chair. He laid on my lap, at the instant,
a copy of Graham’s Magazine for December. As
John did so, he heaved a sigh, and then, as if something
was on his mind, busied himself in arranging
various articles in the room. I knew by these tokens
that he was desirous of attracting my attention. The
woe-begone expression which he wore during all
this time, amused me, for I fancied I could guess
what was passing through his mind. As I quietly
cut the pages of the book, I indulged him by opening
the conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, John,” I said, “it is finished. ‘The Reefer’
has followed my own adventures, and you will have
no more trouble in acting as proof-reader for me.
Our days,” and here, at the use of the plural, the old
fellow grinned from ear to ear, “our days of authorship
are over. I think we had better retire while
our laurels are green. Are you not glad?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glad! What for Massa Danforth think that? No,
no,” and he shook his grey head mournfully, “John
<span class='it'>not</span> glad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And why not, John? We shall have more time
to ourselves. I’m afraid,” I said, looking towards the
window, and endeavoring to peer through the twilight
without, “I am afraid our planting is sadly behind
hand—the clump of trees out yonder wants
thinning—and then the water-fall is getting out of
order—and Mrs. Danforth has been pleading for an
addition to her garden—all this requires overseeing—and
besides these, there are a thousand other things
which will require our attention.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could see that the old fellow had, with difficulty,
restrained himself until I had finished; for he kept
moving his body unceasingly, and once or twice had
opened his mouth to speak. He now broke out—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nebber do, Massa Danforth, nebber do to give up
authorship, take old John word for dat. You now
great man—talk of in all de papers—it Massa Danforth
here and Massa Danforth dare—ebbery few
month you get extra puff in de prospective of de
Magazine—and think you discontinue if you give
ober writing? Gor amighty nebber! Ebbery body
can do planting,—dere Massa Jones, Massa Tyson,
Massa Smit, and de oder blockheads in de county—but
you be only one hereabout been to sea, or can
drive a pen ober paper like a four-in-hand, polishing
skrimanges for a hundred thousand readers—for dat
many Massa Graham say thumb his book ebbery
month. It plain text, plain sermon. Who so big as
Massa Danforth de author?—who so little, beg pardon
for say it, as Massa Danforth de farmer? De
public like our sleepy boy Joe in de kitchen, he nebber
know any one alive, unless dey keep bawling, bawling
in his ear all de time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what am I to do?” said I, smiling at his earnestness,
and peculiar style of illustration. “Even
if I wished to continue an author, I could not. My
own adventures are published; so are those of the
Reefer,—if I go on, I must—to say nothing of the
trouble—draw on my fancy, and that, you know,
wouldn’t do. I always bear in mind what honest
Sancho Panza says—‘Let every one take heed how
they talk or write of people, and not set down at random
the first thing that comes into their imagination.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Massa Sanka Pancer had better keep his advice
to himself, dat my mind—I nebber saw him here, or
read his name in de papers, and he derefore no great
shakes—but I no see dat dere be an accessory for
any fiction about it. Ah! I hab him—I hab him. I
think of a new feature.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A new feature! Well—let’s hear it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But first, dere be accessory for a story. Once
Massa know I be a poor scoundrel in newspaper
office—hard life dat, where kicks plenty and dinners
scarce—and ebbery now and den when editor pushed
to de wall for cash, he say in his paper dat de next
day he come out wid a new feature. Well, ebbery
body, besure, be on tip-toe. Office run down next
mornin for paper. Massa editor fill his pockets for
once anyhow—no trouble, little cost, all wit do it.
How? He put in new head to his paper, and call
dat ‘new feature.’ Now, suppose Massa Danforth
get a new head to ‘Cruising in de Last War,’ and so
be author, and dat widout trouble, for anoder year.
Ah! ha! dat grand stroke.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I laughed heartily at the proposal, but replied—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would never do, John—but I must tell
Graham of your idea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh! what?—put old John in print. Gor amighty
dat make him grand as de minister—not dat he care
much for it—he not vain—but, but, what Massa
gwine to say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll know in good time—but at present see
who knocks at the library door.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Package forgot at post-office,” said John, returning
from his errand, and giving me a huge bundle of
manuscript.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! what have we here? A letter from Graham,
I declare. What says he?—‘a valuable private
history of the revolutionary times,’—‘only wants a
little pruning’—‘thrilling adventures’—‘a run unsurpassed
for years’—‘unequalled’—‘edit it as a
great favor’—and so forth. Well, let us see what
it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh! yes—see what he is. Massa Graham one
<span class='it'>obi</span> man, he know de quandary we in, and send dis
to settle de argument. No escape now, Massa Danforth—it
little trouble—thank God! you be great man
still—and de people still say as we drive out togedder,
‘dare go de celebrated Massa Danforth, and his
man John!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now, reader, having acquainted you with the
manner in which the following history came into my
hands, and given you a hint as to the reasons which
have induced me to appear again in print, I will
take leave of you without further parley, and let the
autobiographer speak for himself.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>THE WRECK.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The parting word had been said, the last look had
been taken, and my traps had all been snugly stowed
away in the narrow room which, for some years,
was to be my home. I stood by the starboard railing
gazing back on the dear city I was leaving, and,
despite the stoicism I had affected when bidding
farewell to my friends, I could not now prevent a
starting tear. Nor did my mess-mates seem in a
more sportive mood; for they could be seen, some
in the rigging and some leaning over the ship’s side,
looking back on the well known landmarks of the
town with a seriousness in the aspect which betokened
the thoughts passing through the heart. Yes!
we were about leaving the scenes of our boyhood,
to enter on a new and untried life—and who knew
if any of us would ever return again to our homes?
The chances of war are at all times dreadful, but in
our case they were terribly increased by the flag
under which we sailed. Who could tell whether
the officers of the revolted colonies might not be
considered as traitors as well as rebels? Who knew
but that the very first enemy we should meet would
either sink us or hang us at the yard arm? And yet,
firm in the righteousness of our cause, and confiding
in the God of battles, there was not one of our number
who, having put his hand to the plough, wished
to turn back. Sink or swim—live or die—we were
resigned to either destiny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Evening was closing fast around the scene, and,
even as I gazed, the town melted into gloom, Copp’s
Hill alone standing up in solemn majesty over
the shadowy city. The distant hum of the town
died fainter and fainter on the darkness, the evening
breeze came up fresher across the waters, the song
of the fisherman and the dip of passing oars ceased,
and, one by one, the white sails of the ships
around us faded away, at first seeming like faint
clouds, but finally losing themselves altogether in
the darkness. All around was still. The low monotonous
ground swell heaving under our counter, and
rippling faintly as it went, alone broke the witching
silence. Not a breath of air was stirring. The
boatswain’s whistle was hushed, the whisper had died
away, no footfall rose upon the stillness, but over
shore and sea, earth and sky, man and inanimate
creation, the same deep silence hung.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually, however, the scene changed. Lights
began to flash along the town and from the ships in
port, and, in a few moments, the harbor was alive
with a long line of effulgence. A half subdued halo
now hung over the city. The effect produced was
like that of magic. Here a ship lay almost buried in
gloom—there one was thrown out in bold relief by
the lights—now a tall warehouse rose shadowy into
the sky, and now one might be seen almost as distinctly
as at noon day. The lights streaming from the
cabin windows and dancing along the bay, the swell
tinged on its crest with silver, but dark as night
below, and the far off sails gleaming like shadowy
spectres, through the uncertain light, added double
effect to the picture. And when the stars came out,
one by one, blinking high up in the firmament, and
the wind began to sigh across the bay and wail sadly
through our rigging, the weird-like character of the
prospect grew beyond description. Hour after hour
passed away and we still continued gazing on the
scene as if under the influence of some magician’s
spell; but, at length, exhausted nature gave way,
and one after another went below, leaving only those
on deck whose duty required their presence. For
myself, though I sought my hammock, a succession
of wild indistinct dreams haunted me throughout the
livelong night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A pleasant breeze was singing through the rigging
as I mounted the gangway at dawn, and the tide
having already made, I knew no time would be lost
in getting under weigh. Directly the captain made
his appearance, and, after a few whispered words,
the pilot issued his orders. In an instant all was
bustle. The boatswain’s whistle, calling all hands
to their duty, was heard shrieking through the ship,
and then came the quick hurried tread of many feet,
as the men swarmed to their stations. The anchor
was soon hove short; the sails were loosed; the
topsails, top-gallant sails and royals were sheeted
home and hoisted,—the head yards were braced
aback and the after yards filled away; a sheer was
made with the helm; the anchor was tripped; the
gib was hoisted; and as she paid beautifully off, the
foretop sail was filled merrily away, and the spanker
hauled out. Then the yards were trimmed, the
anchor catted, and with a light breeze urging us on,
we stood gallantly down the bay. As we increased
our distance from the town, the wind gradually
freshened. One after another of the green islands
around us faded astern; the heights of Nahant opened
ahead, glanced by and frowned in our wake; and
before the sun had been many hours on his course,
we were rolling our yard arms in a stiff breeze,
leagues to sea. Before sun-down the distant coast
had vanished from sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My mess mates had already gathered around the
table in the long narrow room which was appropriated
to the midshipmen, when I dove down the
hatchway after the watch had been set. They were
as jovial a set as I had ever seen, and, although our
acquaintance was but of twenty-four hours standing,
we all felt perfectly at home with each other; and
as the salt beef was pushed from hand to hand, and
the jug passed merrily around, the mutual laugh and
jest bore token of our “right good fellowship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pretty craft, my lads,” said a tall fine-looking
fellow, obviously the senior of the group, and
whom I had been introduced to as a Mr. O’Hara; “a
pretty craft and a bold captain we have, or I’m no
judge. I’ve been at sea before, but never in as gallant
a ship as this. Here’s success to <span class='sc'>The Arrow</span>—no
heel-taps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The toast was drunk with a huzza, and O’Hara
continued the conversation, as if, under the circumstances,
he felt that he was the only proper person to
play the host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re most of you green-horns, my boys—excuse
the word, but ‘tell the truth,’ you know—and
will not be good for much if this swell continues.
One or two of you are getting pale already, and, if
I’m not mistaken, Cavendish and I are the only two
of the set that have smelt salt water before. Now,
take a word of advice. Cut into the beef like the
deuce, never mind if it does make you worse, cut
away still, and bye and bye, when you get all your
long shore swash out of you, you’ll find that you feel
better than ever. We’re for a long voyage, and
many a hard rub you’ll get before it’s over, but never
flinch from duty or danger—even if Davy Jones
himself stares you in the face. Kick care to the
wall, and be merry while you may. But always
have an eye to what is due to your superiors. The
captain’s a gentleman. God bless him! The first
lieutenant, I’ve a notion, is a sour sinner—never let
him catch you tripping,—but you needn’t mind him
further, for he looks as if he ought to be tarred and
feathered as the Boston boys served the exciseman.
And now, lads, here’s to a prosperous voyage, and
let’s turn in, one and all, for I’ve got the morning
watch, and I’ve a notion this breeze will have settled
down into a regular hurricane, and be blowing great
guns and marlin-spikes before then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The air of easy good-humor with which O’Hara
spoke, attracted me to him at once. He was evidently
my senior, and had seen some service; but it was
equally as evident that he affected no superiority
which was not his of right. I determined to know
him better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was still dark when I was aroused from sleep
by the calling of the watch, and, hastily springing up,
I soon stood upon the deck. The first glance around
me proved that O’Hara’s anticipations were fulfilled,
for the tempest was thundering through the rigging
with an almost stunning voice, driving the fine spray
wildly along, and blowing with an intensity that
threatened to sweep one overboard. The men, bent
before the blast, and wrapped in their thick overcoats,
stood like statues half seen through the mist. The
night was bitterly cold—the fine spray cut to the
marrow. As far as the eye could see, on every hand
around us, the sea, flattened until it was nearly as
level as a table, was a mass of driving foam. The
binnacle lamp burned faint and dim, with a sickly
halo, through the fog. Above, however, all was
clear, except a few white fleecy clouds, driven wildly
across the frosty stars that twinkled in the heavens.
As I ran my eye along the tall taper masts, now
bending like rushes in the hurricane, I saw that nearly
all the canvass had been taken in, and that we were
scudding before the tempest with nothing spread but
a close-reefed maintopsail, a reefed fore-course, and
the foretopmast staysail,—and even these, as they
strained in the gale, threatened momently to blow
out into ribbons before the resistless fury of the
wind. Under this comparative press of canvass,
<span class='sc'>The Arrow</span> was skimming along, seeming to outvie
even the spray in velocity. And well was it that
she sped onward with such hot haste!—for, on
looking astern, I saw the billows howling after us,
urging on their white crests in fearful proximity, and
threatening at every surge to roll in over our taffrail.
Wilder and wilder, more and even more fiercely
they raced each other in the pursuit, like a pack
of famished wolves pitching and yelling after their
prey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Keep her so,” said the first lieutenant, as he left
the deck in charge of his successor, “for you see it
is neck and neck with those yelling monsters astern.
If the sails are blown from the bolt ropes they must
go—but as the canvass is new I think they will
stand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ship ahoy!” shouted a look-out at this moment,
startling us as though a thunderbolt had fallen at our
feet, “a sail athwart hawse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where, where?” exclaimed both the officers
incredulously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Close under our fore-foot—a brig, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My God, we shall run her down,” was the exclamation
of the second lieutenant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All eyes were instantly turned in the direction of
the approaching danger, and there, sure enough,
directly athwart our hawse, a small trim-looking brig
was seen lying-to—the wild hurricane of flying
spray, which covered the surface of the deck in places
with an almost impervious fog, having hitherto concealed
her from our sight. It was evident that the
inmates of the brig had but just discovered us, for
her helm was rapidly shifted and a few hurried
orders, whose import we could not make out, were
given on board of her. All, indeed, seemed confusion
on the decks of the unhappy craft. Her crew were
hurrying to and fro; the officer of the vessel was
shouting in his hoarsest tone; two or three forms, as
if those of passengers, rushed up the companion way;
and to crown all, the sheets were let fly, and with
a wild lurch she rolled over, and lay the next moment
wallowing in the sea broadside on. I could almost
have jumped on her decks. All this had passed with
the rapidity of thought. Never shall I forget the
shriek of horror which burst simultaneously from
both vessels at this fearful crisis. Already were we
close on to the brig, driving with the speed of a sea-gull
with the gale, and we knew that before another
moment should elapse, aye! almost before another
breath could be drawn, the collision must lake place.
But the lightning is not quicker than was the officer
of the deck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Port—a-port—ha-a-rd, <span class='it'>hard</span>,” he thundered,
grinding the words between his teeth in his excitement,
and waving his hands to larboard, and the
helmsman, taking his cue more from the gesture than
from the words—for in the uproar of the tempest he
could not hear a dozen yards to windward—whirled
around the wheel, and our gallant craft, obedient to the
impulse like a steed beneath the spur, swept around
to starboard. For a second the ill-fated brig could be
seen dancing under our stem, and then, rolling heavily
around, she seemed as if she would escape, though
narrowly, from her frightful position. A cry of joy
was already rising to my lips; but, at that instant, I
heard a crash, followed by a dull grinding noise, and
simultaneously I beheld the brig come into collision
with us just abaft the cathead, and, while all our
timbers quivered with the shock, she whirled away
astern, rolling and rubbing frightfully, and half buried
in the brine. A shriek rent the air, on the instant,
whose thrilling tones haunted me for days and nights,
and seems even now to ring in my ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God of my fathers!” I exclaimed, “every soul
will be lost!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heave her to,” thundered the officer of the deck.
“For life or death, my lads! Up with the foresail—down
with your helm—brace up the after yards—set
the mizzen stay sail there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a libel on sailors to say they never feel. No
men are more ready to aid the unfortunate. On the
present occasion the crew seemed inspired with an
energy equal to that of their officer, and springing to
their duty performed the rapid orders of the lieutenant
in an almost incredible space of time. Happily a
momentary lull aided the manœuvre, and our proud
craft obeying her helm came gallantly to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meet her there, quarter-master,” continued the
officer of the deck; “set the main stay-sail—brace
up the fore-yards—merrily, merrily—there she has
it—” and, as these concluding words left his mouth,
the manœuvre was finished, and we rode against the
wind, rising and falling on the swell, and flinging the
spray to our fore-yard arm as we thumped against the
seas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My first thought was of the brig. As soon, therefore,
as our craft had been hove-to, I cast a hurried
glance over the starboard bow to search for the
unfortunate vessel. I detected her at once lying a
short distance on our weather bow,—and it was
evident that the injury she had sustained was of the
most serious character, for even through the mist
we fancied we could see that she was settling deeper
in the water. Her officers were endeavoring to heave
her to again; while rising over their orders, and
swelling above all the uproar of the hurricane, we
could hear the despairing wail of her passengers. At
length she lay-to a few fathoms on our starboard
bow, drifting, however, at every surge bodily to
leeward. Confusion still reigned on her decks. We
could see that the crew were at the pumps; but they
appeared to work moodily and with little heart; and
we caught now and then the sound of voices as if of
the officers in expostulation with the men. A group
of female figures also was discernible on the quarter-deck,
and a manly form was visible in the midst,
as if exhorting them to courage. At the sight a thrill
of anguish ran through our breasts. We would have
laid down our lives to save them from what appeared
to be their inevitable doom, and yet what could we
do in the face of such a tempest, and when any attempt
to rescue them would only entail ruin on the adventurers,
without aiding those we would preserve?
As I thought of the impossibility of rendering succor
to those shrinking females, as I dwelt on the lingering
agonies they would have to endure, as I pictured to
myself the brig sinking before our eyes, and we all
powerless to prevent it, a thrill of horror shivered
through every nerve of my system, my blood ran
cold, my brain reeled around, and I could with difficulty
prevent myself from falling, so great was my
emotion. But rallying my spirits, I tried to persuade
myself it was all a dream. I strained my eyes through
the mist to see whether I might not be mistaken—to
discover if possible some hope for the forlorn
beings on board the brig. But, alas! it was in vain.
There were the white dresses blowing about in the
gale as the two females knelt on the deck and clung
to the knees of their protector—there was the crew
mustered at the pumps, while jets of brine were
pouring from the scuppers—and there were the
crushed and splintered bulwarks betokening that the
efforts of the men were dictated by no idle fears.
I groaned again in agony. Had it been my own fate
to perish thus, I could have borne my doom without
a murmur; but to see fellow creatures perishing
before my sight, without my having the power to
succor them, was more than I could endure. I closed
my eyes on the dreadful scene. Nor were my
emotions confined to myself. Not a heart of our vast
crew that did not beat with sympathy for our unhappy
victims. Old and young, officers and men, hardy
veterans and eager volunteers, all alike owned the
impulses of humanity, and stood gazing, silent, spell-bound
and horror-struck, on the ill-fated brig and her
despairing passengers. At this instant a gray-haired
man, whom we knew at once to be her skipper,
sprung into the main-rigging of the wreck, and
placing his hands to his mouth, while his long
silvery locks blew out dishevelled on the gale,
shouted,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We—are—sink-ing!” and, as he ceased, a
shiver ran through our crew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God help us,” said the captain, for that officer
had now reached the deck, “we can do nothing for
them. And to see them sink before our eyes! But
yet I will not despair,” and raising his voice, he
shouted, “can’t you hold on until morning, or until
the gale subsides a little?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The skipper of the brig saw by our captain’s gestures,
that he had hailed, but the old man could not
hear the words in the uproar of the gale, and he shook
his head despondingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are sinking!” he shouted again; “there is a
foot of water in the hold, and the sea is pouring in
like a cataract. We have been stove.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never shall I forget that moment, for, to our excited
imaginations, it seemed as if the brig was visibly
going down as the skipper ceased speaking. His
words sounded in our ears like the knell of hope.
A pause of several seconds ensued—a deep, solemn,
awe-inspiring pause—during which every eye was
fixed on the battered vessel. Each man held his
breath, and looked in the direction of the brig, as she
rose and fell on the surges, fearful lest the next
billow would submerge her forever. We all saw
that it was useless to attempt holding any communication
with her, for no human voice, even though
speaking in a voice of thunder, could be heard against
the gale. The two vessels were, moreover, rapidly
increasing the space betwixt them,—and, although
objects on the deck of the brig had been at first
clearly perceptible in the starlight, they had gradually
grown dimmer as she receded from us until now, they
could scarcely be seen. There was no alternative,
therefore, but to abandon her to her fate. The skipper
of the brig seemed to have become sensible of this,
for, after having remained in the main rigging watching
us for several moments longer, he finally descended
to the deck, waving his hand mournfully in
adieu.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime the aspect of the heavens had materially
changed. When I first came on deck, the stars, I
have said, were out bright on high, with only a few
scud clouds now and then chasing each other over
the firmament. Even then, however, I had noticed
a small black cloud extending across the western
horizon, and giving an ominous aspect to the whole
of that quarter of the sky. But during the last half
hour my attention had been so engrossed by the
events I have just related that I lost all consciousness
of this circumstance. Now, however, the increasing
darkness recalled it to my mind. I looked up. Already
dark and ragged clouds, precursors of the vast body
of vapors following behind, were dimming the stars
overhead, now wrapping the decks in almost total
darkness, and now flitting by and leaving us once
more in a dim and shadowy light, through which the
men loomed out like gigantic spectres. The wind
had perceptibly decreased, while the sea had risen
in proportion. The spray no longer flew by in showers,
but the white caps of the billows, as they rolled
up in the uncertain light, had a ghastliness that thrilled
the heart with a strange emotion, almost amounting
to superstitious dread. The ship strained and creaked
as she rose heavily on the billows, or sunk wallowing
far down in the abyss; while ever and anon the
sea would strike on her bows like a forge-hammer,
breaking in showers of spray high over the forecastle,
and often sending its foam as far back as the main
hatchway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The huge mass of vapors meanwhile had attained
the zenith, and was rolling darkly onward towards
the opposite horizon. Directly the wind died nearly
altogether away, while a total darkness shrouded us
in its folds. Even then, however, a few stars could
be seen low in the eastern seaboard, twinkling sharp
and serene, just under the edge of that ominous
cloud, but casting only a faint and dreamy radiance
around them, and in vain attempting to penetrate the
gloom higher up in the sky. The brig was last seen
to the north-west, where the darkness had become
most intense. She was still doubtless in that quarter,
but no trace of her could be discerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s as black up yonder as the eye of death,” said
the captain, “and I can see nothing there but a dense,
impenetrable shadow—your sight is better, Mr.
Duval,” he continued, addressing the first lieutenant,
“can you make out any thing?” The officer shook
his head. “Well, we will hail, at any rate. I would
not have run afoul of them for my commission!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hail rung out startlingly on the night, and
every ear listened for the response. No answer
came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Again!” said the captain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A-ho-o-y!—Hil-lo-o-o-o!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A second of breathless suspense followed, and
then another, when we were about giving up all
hope; but at that instant a faint cry,—it might have
been a wail or it might not, God knows!—came
floating across the waste of waters. It fell on our
listening ears like a lamentation for the dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Heaven preserve us!” solemnly said the captain,
“I’m afraid all is over with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Amen!” ejaculated the lieutenant, and for an
instant there was a breathless silence, as if each
was too awe-struck to speak. Suddenly the huge
sails flapped against the mast, bellied out again, and
then whipped backward with a noise like thunder.
The effect was electric. The captain started and
spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The wind is shifting,” he ejaculated, holding up
his hand, after having first wet it slightly; “ha! the
breeze is coming from the north. It will strike by the
mainmast. Let her stretch away at first, but we’ll
heave-to as soon as possible. I wouldn’t for the
world desert this neighborhood: God grant we may
find some vestige of the brig when morning dawns!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hurried orders of the officer of the deck to
prepare for the coming hurricane had scarcely been
given and executed, before it seemed to us as if we
could see, even amid the blackness of darkness to
the north, the whirling motion of gigantic clouds,
and, almost simultaneously, with a roar as of ten
thousand batteries, this new tempest was upon us.
Its first fury was beyond description—surpassing
imagination—defying belief. It howled, shrieked,
and bellowed through the rigging in such awful and
varied tones, that the oldest hearts were chilled with
fear. It was as if the last convulsive throe of a
world was at hand. It was as if the whole fury of
the elements had been collected for one last effort—as
if tortured nature, made frantic by agony, had
broke loose from her tormentors—as if the mighty
deep itself, in horror-struck penitence, was thundering
its awful “<span class='it'>de profundis</span>” on the eve of final
dissolution. I could scarcely breathe, much less
stand. I could only grasp a rope, fling myself almost
prostrate, and await either the subsidence of the
storm, or the foundering of our ship,—for, during
several minutes, it appeared to me as if every second
was to be our last. Torrents of water, meanwhile,
swept in sheets from the crests of the billows, were
whirling like smoke-wreathes along the decks,—while
the ravening surges, faintly seen like shadows
through the gloom, chased each other in wild and
rapid succession along our sides. All was darkness,
doubt and terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But happily the duration of the squall was proportioned
to its intensity, and, in less than five minutes,
the hurricane began to decrease in violence. After
the lapse of a short period more the gale rapidly
subsided, although its power was still considerable.
Before half an hour, however, we were lying-to as
near to our old position as we could attain,—having
suffered no loss except that of our maintopsail,
which was blown from the bolt ropes in the first
moment of the squall, but with a noise which was
lost in the louder uproar of the wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They have never survived this,” said the captain
in a melancholy tone, when we were once more
snugly hove-to: “how many souls are in eternity
the All-Seeing Eye only knows! Keep her here,”
he added after a pause, turning to descend to his
cabin, and addressing the officer of the deck, “and
with the first streak of light, if the gale shall have
abated, as I suspect it will, cruize up to our old position,
maintaining a sharp look-out in every direction.
But I shall be on deck myself by that time,” and with
the words, taking a last but fruitless look towards
the west, he went below. In half an hour the
crowded decks were deserted by all except the silent
watch; and no sound broke the whistle of the winds,
except the tread of the men, or the cry of “all’s
well” passing from look-out to look-out along the
decks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the first appearance of morning I was on
deck. The gale had nearly gone down; the clouds
had broken away; and the stars were out again, clear
and bright, in the firmament. Yet the waves still
rolled mountain high around us, now heaving their
snowy crests above us in the sky, and now rolling
their dark bosoms far away under our stern. Morning
slowly dawned. Gradually, one by one, the stars
paled on high, and a faint shadowy streak of light
began to spread along the eastern seaboard. Over
the boundless expanse of waters around us no living
object met the eye, so that, in that dim mysterious
light, the sense of loneliness was overpowering. But
I had no thought then for aught except the ill-fated
brig. I felt an unaccountable interest in her. It
seemed as if some unknown sympathy existed betwixt
me and those on board of her, as if my destiny
in some mysterious manner was connected with
theirs. I could not rest on deck, but ascending to the
cross-trees I took my station there, and gazed out
anxiously over the waste of waters. Our ship had,
by this time, been put about, and we were now, as
near as I could judge, in the vicinity of the spot
where the collision occurred. The moment came
which was either to realize or confirm my fears. A
strange emotion took possession of me. My heart
beat nervously, my breath came heavily, I trembled
in every fibre of my system. I strained my eyes in
every direction around, and, once or twice, as a
billow rolled its white crest upwards, I fancied I
saw a sail,—but, alas! my agitation had deceived
me, and all was a blank watery waste around. For
more than an hour we cruized to and fro, but in
vain. As time passed and hope died away, the officers
and men, one by one, left the rigging, until finally
even the captain gave up the search, and issued a
reluctant order to put the ship away on her course.
At that instant I saw, far down on the seaboard, what
seemed to me a tiny sail; but as we sank in the
trough of the sea the object faded from my sight.
With eager eyes, I watched for it as we rose on the
swell, and—God of my fathers!—it was the long
looked for boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A sail!” I shouted almost in a phrenzy—“they
are in sight!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where away?” demanded the officer of the
deck, while every eye swept the horizon in eager
curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the lee-beam!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you make it out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A ship’s launch—crowded with human beings!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God be praised!—it is the brig’s crew,” ejaculated
the captain. “Up with your helm, quarter-master—around
with her all—there she dances,”
and as he spoke the gallant ship wheeled around and
in a few minutes the brig’s launch was rocking under
our bows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The discipline of a man-of-war could scarcely
suppress the loudest demonstrations of emotion on
the part of the crew, when the freight of that tempest-tost
launch reached our decks. The sailors of the
brig were instantly seized by our tars, and borne
forward in triumph,—while our superior grasped the
hand of the rescued skipper with visible emotion.
But when the two females, with their protector,
an elderly, gentlemanly looking man, were safely
landed on the quarter-deck, every eye was at once
attracted to the interesting group. Both the females
were young and beautiful, but one was surpassingly
lovely. As I gazed on her, it seemed as if some long
forgotten dream had come back to me; but in vain
were my attempts to give it reality. At this instant
their protector spoke in reply to a question from the
captain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is indeed a miracle that we are saved. The
brig went down in that fearful squall, and though
we had taken to the launch, as a last hope, we did not
believe we should live a minute in such a hurricane.
But an Omnipotent Power preserved us for some
wise ends. All night long we were tossed at the
mercy of the waves. We saw you long before you
saw us, and thought that you had given up the search,
when suddenly your head was brought around in
our direction—and here we stand on your decks.
To whom are we indebted for our discovery? We
owe him our eternal gratitude.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All eyes were instantly turned towards me, and
the captain taking me by the hand, said,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Cavendish has that enviable honor,” at the
same time presenting me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cavendish!” exclaimed a silvery female voice in
delighted surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the mention of that name I looked up with eager
curiosity, and saw the eyes of the lovely speaker
fixed upon me, as if in recognition. She crimsoned
to the brow at my eager glance, and as she did so,
the crowd of dim recollections in my mind assumed
a definite shape, and I recognized in that sweet
smile, in that delicately tinted cheek, in those now
tearful eyes, in that lustrous brow, the features of
my old playmate <span class='sc'>Annette</span>!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cavendish—what, little Henry Cavendish?” exclaimed
the gentleman, eagerly seizing my hand,
“yes! it is even so, although the years that have
passed since you used to visit Pomfret Hall have
almost eradicated your features from my memory.
God bless you, my gallant young friend! We owe
you our lives—our all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scene that ensued I will not attempt to describe.
Suffice it to say I retired that night with a
whirl of strange emotions at my heart. Was it
<span class='sc'>Love</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>I have</span> been thinking, Henry, that I should like to
invite cousin Agatha to spend the winter with us:
what do you say to my plan?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, Alice, I can say nothing about it, since
I know nothing of the lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I had forgotten that you had never seen her;
she is only distantly related to us, but being left an
orphan at an early age, she became an inmate of our
family and continued to reside with us until she married.
Agatha is several years my senior, and entered
society while I was yet in the school-room; she
married rather in opposition to the wishes of my
parents, as they approved neither of the profession
nor the character of her husband, who was an officer
in the army, and known to be a man of dissolute
habits. Poor thing! she has fully paid the penalty of
her folly during seven years of poverty and discomfort.
Her husband has been sent from one frontier
station to another, until the health of both was destroyed,
and at the time of his death they were both
at Sackett’s Harbor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then she is a widow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, her vile husband died about a year since, and
cousin Agatha is released from bondage, but reduced
to actual penury. I received a letter from her yesterday,
the first she has written since my marriage, and
she alludes most touchingly to her desolate condition
as contrasted with my happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that letter, I suppose, induced you to think
of inviting her to spend the winter with us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It did, Harry; for I felt as if it was almost selfish
in me to be so happy when my early friend was
pining in loneliness and poverty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love the kindliness of feeling which prompts
you to such acts, dear Alice, but, to confess the truth,
I would rather relieve your cousin’s distresses in any
other way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there is no other way of doing so, Henry—she
would not accept pecuniary aid from us: why do
you object to her visit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because we are so happy that I dread any interruption
to the calm current of our life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, dear Harry, I cannot find it in my
heart to scold you for your selfishness,” said the
young wife, as she laid her hand on her husband’s
arm; “but really,” she continued, “Cousin Agatha
would be the last person in the world to disturb our
tranquillity. She is full of gentleness and sentiment;
a creature of warm and affectionate impulses, and
she would delight in adding to our enjoyments. You
know my health will confine me to the house this winter,
and you may find the long evenings hang heavy
upon your hands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in your society, Alice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad you think so, Harry; but when I am
languid and dispirited from indisposition, you would
find cousin Agatha a charming companion; besides,
she would relieve me from some of the cares of
house-keeping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, my dear, you offer so many good reasons
in favor of her coming, that I can find no argument
against it, but I have a sort of a presentiment that
she will not be agreeable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Harry, how can you think so? if you could
see her you would change your opinions very soon,
for her picturesque appearance would charm your
artistical taste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she very beautiful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, but she is just the person to please a painter,
for there is so beautiful a combination of light and
shade in her face. She has those grey eyes which,
when fringed with long, dark lashes, are so full of
varied expression, and her hair, black as the raven’s
wing, falls in heavy natural ringlets that put to shame
the skill of a <span class='it'>coiffeur</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May she not be altered since you saw her, Alice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True, I had forgotten that more than five years
have passed since we last met; but, even if her person
has changed, her heart, I am sure, has not, and
when you know her you will thank me for my pertinacity
in thus wringing your reluctant consent to her
visit.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you think it will add to your enjoyments, Alice,
invite her by all means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice Wentworth had been a wife scarcely two
years, and her married life had been a scene of uninterrupted
happiness. Nothing would have induced
her to risk the disturbance of her tranquillity, but remembering
the companion of her early years as one
who had been the confidant of all her childish joys
and sorrows, she looked upon her presence as the
completion of her plans of enjoyment. Her husband’s
scruples she naturally attributed to unfounded
prejudice which an acquaintance with her cousin
could not fail to overcome, and, therefore, following
the dictates of kindly feeling, she determined to cheer
the bereaved widow by an affectionate letter of invitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some three weeks after she had despatched her
missive, at an early hour, on a cold autumnal morning,
a carriage drove up to the door, and a loud ring
announced the expected guest. Alice had not yet
finished her morning toilet, and Mr. Wentworth
hastened down to receive the lady; but scarcely had
he got through the awkwardness of a self-introduction
when his wife entered, full of impatience to
embrace her early friend. During the mutual raptures
of their meeting, he had leisure to scrutinize
the new inmate of his family, and certainly his impressions
were any thing but favorable. Cousin
Agatha had taken a violent cold, her countenance
was disfigured by a swollen cheek, and her eyes were
bleared and inflamed by a severe attack of influenza,
while the effect of steamboat slumbers and a steamboat
toilet did not tend to the improvement of her
appearance. Indeed Harry Wentworth could scarcely
refrain from laughter when he contrasted his wife’s
enthusiastic description with the reality before him.
But Alice, with ready hospitality, conducted her cousin
to her apartment, and to that room the wearied
traveller, overcome with illness and fatigue, was
confined during the several succeeding days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When will your friend be presentable, Alice?”
asked Mr. Wentworth one evening as he threw
himself upon a sofa, after tea, “since she has been
here you have not sat with me a half hour, for
your whole time seems devoted to nursing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope she will be well enough to meet you at
dinner to-morrow, Harry; the swelling has left her
face and she begins to look like herself. What
amuses you so much?” she asked, as her husband
burst into a loud laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was thinking of the force of contrast, Alice; you
are an excellent painter, dear, but you draw your tints
too exclusively from fancy; who could have recognized
your <span class='it'>picturesque beauty</span> with soft <span class='it'>grey eyes</span> and
<span class='it'>raven curls</span> in the dowdyish looking woman with red
nose and redder eyes whom I welcomed as cousin
Agatha?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For shame, Harry, you ought not to judge of her
by her appearance at that time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not; but first impressions are the most durable,
and I shall never see any beauty in your cousin,
for even if she should hereafter appear to advantage
when dressed for display, I shall never forget how
she looked in her travelling dishabille; one thing
you may be sure of, Alley, you will never have cause
to be jealous of your <span class='it'>picturesque</span> cousin.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mean to be jealous of any one, Harry,
but I shall be much mistaken if you do not learn to
admire cousin Agatha.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you may prepare yourself for a disappointment,
Alice; I do not think I should feel perfectly
satisfied with any one who had thus broken in
upon our tranquil happiness, and even if I were disposed
to like your cousin elsewhere she would not
please me in our quiet home. Besides, I was disappointed
in my idea of her personal beauty, and her
manners appeared to me abrupt and inelegant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harry, you never were more mistaken in your
life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, well—it will be difficult to convince me
of my error.” A slight rustle at the door was heard
as Mr. Wentworth finished his ungallant speech, and
the next moment cousin Agatha entered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought I would endeavor to make my way to
the drawing-room instead of depriving you any longer
of the society of your husband, dear Alice,” said
she as she languidly sank into the softly-cushioned
chair which Mr. Wentworth drew forward for her
accommodation. Of course the usual congratulations
followed, and as the invalid dropped the heavy shawl
from her shoulders, Alice glanced towards her husband
in the hope that he would not fail to observe
the symmetry of her petite figure. He was too great
an admirer of beauty to fail in such notice, yet still
he could see little to claim admiration in her face.
Her complexion was not clear; her mouth, though
well formed and adorned with superb teeth, was
large, and her eyes were dim from recent illness,
while her curls were hidden beneath one of those
fairy fabrics of gossamer and ribbon which often display
the taste of the wearer at the expense of a
crowning beauty. But, ere the evening had expired,
Mr. Wentworth was forced to acknowledge that he
had formed too hasty an opinion of her manners, for,
whatever <span class='it'>brusquerie</span> he might have observed on the
morning of her arrival, he was certainly struck now
by the easy elegance and graceful dignity of her
deportment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this time cousin Agatha laid aside the character
of an invalid, and, quietly taking her place at
the table and fireside, seemed to have no other wish
than to make herself useful. Devoted in her attentions
to Alice, she took little notice of Mr. Wentworth
except to receive his courteous civility with
profound gratitude. He was nothing more to her
than the husband of her friend, and while she exhibited
the deepest interest in the development of Alice’s
mind and feelings, she seemed scarcely to observe
the fine taste, the elegant scholarship, and the nobleness
of sentiment which characterized Mr. Wentworth.
Alice suffered no small degree of mortification
from this evident coldness between those whom she
was so anxious to behold friends. She could not bear
to find Agatha so totally blind to the perfections of her
beloved Henry, and she was almost as much annoyed
at her husband’s indifference to the graces of
her cousin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are pained because I do not sufficiently admire
your husband, Alice,” said Agatha, one day,
when they were alone, “but surely you would not
have me estimate him as highly as you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would not have you love him quite as well, but
I would have you appreciate his exalted qualities.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear coz,” said Agatha, with a slightly sarcastic
smile, “do not, I pray you, make it one of the
conditions of our friendship that I should see through
your eyes. Mr. Wentworth is a fine scholar, a tolerable
amateur painter, and a most ardent lover of his
pretty wife; is that not sufficient praise?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice felt uncomfortable, though she could scarcely
tell why, at this and similar remarks from cousin
Agatha. She had been accustomed to consider her
husband a being of superior worth and endowments,
but there was something in her cousin’s manner of
uttering commendation of him, which seemed to imply
contempt even while it expressed praise. In the
innocence of her heart, Alice several times repeated
cousin Agatha’s sayings to her husband, and they
were not without their effect upon him. The self-love
which exists, more or less, in every heart, was
by no means a negative quantity in the character of
Mr. Wentworth. He knew his wife overrated his
talents, but he loved her the better for her affectionate
flattery, and cousin Agatha’s apparent ignorance of
his character mortified and vexed him. He began to
think that his prejudices had prevented him from
showing himself in a proper light, and his wounded
vanity led him to redouble his attentions to his guest.
Heretofore he had never thought of her except when
in her company; but now, the certainty that she was
as yet blind to his merits, made her an object of interest.
He was not a very vain man, but his wife’s
idolatry had gratified even while he was fully aware
of its extravagance, and he was proportionably annoyed
by the perfect coldness with which cousin
Agatha regarded him. She seemed to think him a
very good sort of a man, but not at all superior to the
common herd, and he was determined to convince
her of her mistake. Agatha had succeeded in her
first design:—she had aroused him from the torpor
of indifference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cousin Agatha was a most invaluable assistant to
a young housekeeper, for she had a quick hand, a
ready invention, and exquisite taste, so that whether
a pudding was to be concocted, a dress trimmed, or
a party given, she was equally useful. Alice had
learned the duties of housekeeping theoretically and
was now only beginning to put them in practice, as
every young wife must do, for whatever she may
know in the home of her childhood, she still finds
much to be learned in organizing and arranging
a new household. Cousin Agatha, on the contrary,
had been trained from her childhood to <span class='it'>do</span> all these
things, for the dependent orphan had early learned to
earn her bread by her own usefulness. In the course
of her married life she had been compelled to practice
the thousand expedients which pride and poverty
teach to a quick-witted woman, and it is not surprising,
therefore, that her skill should far surpass that of
the gentle and self-distrusting Alice. Doubting her
own knowledge only because Agatha was near to advise,
the young wife applied to her on all occasions,
until at length the regulation of domestic affairs was
entirely in her hands, and Alice was left only to assist
in the execution of Agatha’s plans. Cousin Agatha
was always busied in some pretty feminine employment.
She had very beautiful hands, and her long
taper fingers were always engaged in some delicate
needle-work or an elegant piece of tapestry. Did it
ever occur to you, my fair reader, that a pretty hand
never appears to such advantage as when busied with
the needle? The piano extends the fingers until the
hand sometimes resembles a bird’s claw;—the pencil
or the pen contracts it until half its beauty is concealed;
but needle-work, with the various turnings
and windings necessary to its accomplishment, displays
both hands in perfectly natural positions and in
every variety of grace. This fact was not unknown
to cousin Agatha; she had no accomplishments, but
she was rarely seen without the tiniest of gold thimbles
upon her slender finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Slowly and by scarcely perceptible degrees, Agatha
seemed to learn the full value of the prize which her
friend had drawn in the lottery of life. His fine
talents seemed to dawn upon her with daily increasing
vividness, his amateur sketches became more
and more characterized by genius, his musical taste
developed itself surprisingly, and, ere many weeks
had elapsed, Alice had the satisfaction of repeating
to her husband many a heart-warm compliment
breathed into the ear of the happy wife by cousin
Agatha in her hours of confidential communing
with her friend. Nor was Mr. Wentworth slower
in discovering the latent charms of his guest. Restored
to her former health, and associating as the
guest of Mrs. Wentworth, in a pleasant circle of society,
cousin Agatha threw aside the weeds of widowhood,
and appeared in all the attractive coquetry of
tasteful and becoming dress. Her luxuriant tresses
were once more allowed to shadow her low feminine
brow, and fall upon her graceful neck, or, if bound
up in conformity with fashion, the very restraint was
studiously arranged in such a manner as to display
their rich redundancy. Her grey eyes sometimes
seemed actually flashing with light, and again were
filled with the soft liquid lustre of intense sensibility;
and then her smile, displaying her brilliant
teeth and lighting up her whole face, had the effect
of a sudden sunbeam upon a darkened landscape.
The charm of Agatha’s face was its vivid and varied
expression; the grace of her person was the effect
of long and carefully studied art. Not a look, not a
gesture, not even a movement of her fringed eyelids,
but was the result of frequent practice. There was
a perfection of grace in her attitudes that seemed like
Nature’s self. Her head always assumed a pretty
position, her curls always seemed to drop in their
proper place, her drapery always fell in becoming
folds, and no one observed that she was particular in
avoiding cross lights, especially careful not to face a
broad glare of sunshine, and remarkably fond of
placing herself at the arm of a sofa, so as to obtain
a fine back ground for the exhibition of her attitudes.
Harry Wentworth wondered how he could ever have
thought her ugly. And then her manners:—what
could be more gentle, more feminine, more fascinating
than the tenderness of her tones and the sweetness
of her deportment? She seemed to look upon
gentlemen as if she felt all a woman’s helplessness,
and was willing to consider man as a “<span class='it'>chevalier sans
peur et sans reproche</span>,” born to be her natural protector.
There was something so pleading in the soft
eyes which she lifted to the face of the sterner sex,
that few could resist their charm, and actually Harry
Wentworth was not one of those few.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Long before the time fixed for the termination of
Agatha’s visit, Alice had urged her to prolong her
stay, and, when Mr. Wentworth added his earnest
entreaties, she was induced to promise that she would
set no other limit to its duration than such as circumstances
might create. But as week after week fleeted
by, Alice began to doubt whether she had acted
wisely in making this request. She was ashamed to
acknowledge even to herself the feeling, but, somehow
or other, she was not quite as happy as she had
been before cousin Agatha’s coming. She attributed
it to the nervous irritability from which she was
now suffering, and endeavored to think that when
she should once more recover her health, she would
find her former enjoyment in Agatha’s society. But
Agatha sometimes made such singular remarks;—they
were uttered with the utmost simplicity and
<span class='it'>naïveté</span>, her smile was full of sweetness, her tones
like the summer breeze when she spoke, and yet the
import of her words was excessively cutting and sarcastic.
There was often an implied censure in her
manner of replying to Alice—not in the words themselves,
but rather in their application, which the
young wife, sick and dispirited, felt perhaps too
keenly. Alice was uncomfortable and yet she scarcely
could tell why. A shadow was resting upon her path,
and she felt, although she saw it not, that there was
a cloud in her sunny sky. The idea that she was
no longer absolutely essential to her husband’s comfort
sometimes crossed her mind. During the many
hours which she was obliged to spend in her own
apartment, she found that Henry was fully occupied
with his game of chess, or his favorite book in company
with cousin Agatha, and though it seemed only
a realization of her own wishes, yet she was not
prepared to find herself so entirely thrown into the
back-ground of the family picture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length Alice became a mother, and in the new
emotions awakened in her bosom, she forgot her
vague feelings of discomfort. Mr. Wentworth was
too proud and happy to think of anything but his
boy, and when Alice beheld him bending over their
cradled treasure with a feeling almost of awe as well
as love, she wondered how she could ever have felt
unhappy for a moment. Cousin Agatha seemed to
share in all their joy, and in the presence of the
father she fondled and caressed the child as gracefully
as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you not think, Alice,” said she one day, as
she sat with the babe lying on her lap, while Wentworth
bent fondly over it, “do you not think your
sweet little Harry resembles poor Charles Wilson?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, indeed I do not,” exclaimed Alice, quickly,
while the blood mounted to her pallid cheek and
brow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I certainly see a strong likeness; there is
the same peculiar dimple in the chin, which neither
you nor Mr. Wentworth have, and even the color
of his eyes reminds me of Charles,” said cousin
Agatha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His eyes are like his father’s,” said Alice, “and
nothing is more common than to see in the face of a
child a dimple which entirely disappears in later life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Alice, dear, I did not mean to awaken any
painful reminiscence by my remark; I did not know
you were so sensitive on the subject.” These words
were uttered in the blandest tones, and the sweet
smile which accompanied them was as beautiful as a
sunbeam on a troubled sea; but Alice felt both pained
and vexed. Agatha had recurred to the only unpleasant
recollections of her whole life, and she could
not determine whether it had been done by design,
or was merely the result of thoughtlessness. The
remark had not been without its effect upon Mr.
Wentworth. He saw with surprise the evident vexation
of his wife at the mention of Charles Wilson’s
name, and while he feared to ask an explanation from
her in her present feeble state of health, he determined
to satisfy his curiosity by appealing to cousin
Agatha.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you never hear of Charles Wilson?” exclaimed
Agatha, in great apparent surprise, when, a
few hours afterwards, he asked the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never until I heard you mention him,” was the
reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I ought not to tell you anything about
him, because I cannot betray the confidence of a
friend.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But as a friend I entreat you to tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is impossible, Mr. Wentworth:—what Alice
has thought best to conceal I certainly will not disclose:
strange that she should not have told you; there
certainly ought to be the most perfect confidence between
husband and wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Agatha, you have excited such a painful interest
in the secret, whatever it is, that I must know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will not betray me to Alice if I tell you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not, if secrecy be the only condition on
which I can learn the truth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you promise not to think harshly of poor
Alice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be strange if I should think other than
well of one whose purity of heart is so well known
to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, then,” replied the insidious woman, with a
slight, a very slight sneer on her lip, “since you have
such undoubting faith in your wife there can be no
harm in telling you. But really we are making a great
affair of a very trifling occurrence. Charles Wilson
was a clerk to Alice’s father, and while she was yet
at school, he made love to her in the hope of enticing
her into a clandestine marriage. Alice was only
about fifteen, and like all girls of her age was delighted
with a first lover. He lived in the house with,
us, and of course enjoyed many opportunities of
meeting her, so that before we knew anything about
it, an elopement was actually planned. I happened
to discover it, and as my duty required, I made it
known to her parents. The consequence was that
Wilson was dismissed and Alice sent to boarding-school;
I dare say she has thanked me for it since,
though then she could not forgive me. You look
pained, Mr. Wentworth. I hope my foolish frankness
has not made you unhappy. I really thought it
such a childish affair that I felt no hesitation in alluding
to it to-day, supposing that Alice had lost all sensitiveness
about it, and I was never more surprised
than by her evident agitation. However, I confess I
was wrong; I ought to have known that an early
disappointment is not easily forgotten even in the
midst of happiness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long since this happened?” asked Mr.
Wentworth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just before I was married—I suppose about
eight years ago; I wonder Alice did not tell you the
whole story, but she is such a timid creature that I
suppose she could not summon courage enough to be
perfectly frank with you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wentworth made no reply, but the poisoned arrow
had reached its mark. His confidence in his wife was
shaken; he had not been the first love of her young
heart,—she had loved and been beloved,—she had
plighted her faith even in her girlhood, and the creature
whom he believed to be as pure in heart as an
infant, had narrowly escaped the degradation of a
clandestine marriage with an inferior. He was
shocked and almost disgusted; he felt heartsick, and
even the sight of his child, connected as it now was
with the similitude of the early lover, was painful to
him. He recalled a thousand trifling circumstances
which would pass by unheeded but for cousin
Agatha’s kind attempts to explain Alice’s meaning,
and all now corroborated his suspicions of his wife’s
perfect sincerity. The more he discussed the matter
with Agatha, the more dissatisfied did he become with
Alice; and in proportion as she fell in his estimation
the frank and noble character of Agatha arose. There
was a high-toned sentiment about her, a sense of
honor and an intensity of feeling which added new
charms to her expressive countenance and graceful
manners. Wentworth was not <span class='it'>in love</span> with Agatha,
but he was a little <span class='it'>out of love</span> with his wife, and the
constant presence of such a fascinating woman, at
such a moment, was certainly somewhat dangerous.
More than once he caught himself regretting that
Alice was not more like her cousin, and long before
Alice was well enough to leave her apartment, he
had become quite reconciled to her absence from the
drawing-room. Alice felt his increasing neglect, but
she dared not allow herself to attribute it to its true
cause. Cousin Agatha was so kind, so attentive to
her, and studied so much the comfort of Mr. Wentworth,
that she almost hated herself for the growing
dislike which she was conscious of feeling towards
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One day, about two months after the birth of her
babe, Alice, who had been suffering from a slow
fever, felt so much better that she determined to surprise
her husband by joining him at dinner. Wrapping
a shawl about her, she slowly proceeded down
stairs, and finding the drawing-room door partly open,
entered so silently as not to disturb the occupants of
the apartment. Mr. Wentworth was lying on a sofa,
while cousin Agatha sat on a low ottoman beside
him, with one hand threading the mazes of his bright
hair, while the other was clasped in his. The face
of Agatha was hidden from her, but the wretched
wife beheld the eyes of her husband upturned towards
it with the most vivid expression of fondness
and passion. Her very soul grew sick as she gazed;
she turned to glide from the room and fell senseless
on the threshold. Weeks had elapsed ere she recovered
her consciousness. The sudden shock which
her weakened nerves had sustained, produced inflammation
of the brain, and for many an anxious day
her husband watched beside her sick bed, dreading
lest every hour should be her last. She lay in a state
of stupor, and her first signs of returning consciousness
was the shiver that ran through her frame when
the voice of cousin Agatha struck upon her ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Wentworth was conscience-stricken when,
aroused by the sound of her fall, he had beheld
Alice lying lifeless on the floor. He uttered not a
word of enquiry, but he readily divined the cause of
her condition, and, as he bore her to her apartment,
he almost hated himself for the brief delirium in
which his senses had been plunged. He could not be
said to love Agatha, but her fascinations had not
been without their effect upon his ardent nature. He
did not attempt to analyse his feelings, but yielding
to the spell which enthralled him, abandoned himself
to the enjoyment of her blandishments. Hour after
hour had he spent in listening to the false sentiment
which fell from her lips in the most honied accents,—evening
after evening had he consumed in attending
her to parties of pleasure,—day after day had been
bestowed on the completion of her portrait, while
Alice was left to the solitude of her sick room. But
now, when he beheld her stricken down at his very
feet, the scales seemed to fall from his eyes, and his
infidelity of heart appeared to him in all its true
wickedness. The toils which the insidious Agatha
had woven about him were broken as if by magic,
and his wife, his long-suffering, wronged Alice was
dearer to him than all the world beside. He watched
by her with all the kindness of early affection, and well
did he understand her abhorrent shudder at the presence
of Agatha. His devoted attention and the <span class='it'>adieus</span>
of cousin Agatha, who now found it necessary to terminate
her visit, had no small share in restoring Alice
to convalescence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Alice was slowly regaining health and strength; the
faint tint of the wild-rose was once more visible on
her thin cheek, and her feeble step had again borne
her to the room so fraught with painful remembrances.
But far different were the feelings with which she
now revisited that neglected apartment. Cousin
Agatha was gone,—she was once more alone with
her husband, and with true womanly affection she
willingly forgot his past errors in his present tenderness.
But there were some things yet to be explained
before perfect confidence could exist between them.
The serpent had been driven from their Paradise, but
its trail had been left on many a flower;—the shadow
of distrust still lay dark upon the pleasant paths
of domestic peace, and yet both shrunk from uttering
the mystic word which might chase its gloom forever.
But the moment of explanation came. A letter from
cousin Agatha was placed in the hands of Alice, and
repressing the shudder with which she looked upon
it, she proceeded to peruse it; but scarcely had she
read three lines, when, with an exclamation of surprise,
she handed it to her husband, and telling him
it interested him no less than herself, begged him to
read it aloud. It was as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='sc'>My sweet Cousin</span>,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I write to repeat my thanks for the exceeding
kindness and hospitality which I received while an
inmate of your family. I feel especially bound to do
this, because, as I am on the point of embarking for
France, I may be unable for several years to offer
my acknowledgments in person. You are doubtless
surprised, but you will perhaps be still more so when
I tell you that I am going to join <span class='it'>my husband</span>. Our
marriage took place more than a year since, but we
thought it prudent to conceal it both on account of
my then recent widowhood, and because my husband
was not then of age. His guardian was opposed to
his union with your penniless cousin, and he was sent
off on a European tour to avoid me; but we were
secretly married before his departure, and as he has
now attained his majority, he has written to me to
meet him in Paris, where I hope to find that domestic
felicity which I failed to derive from my former unhappy
connection. By the way, my dear Alice, I
fancied, when I was at your house, that there was
some little coldness existing between you and your
husband. I sincerely hope that I was mistaken, and
that it was my love for you which rendered me too
observant of the little differences which frequently
occur in married life. I think Mr. Wentworth was
piqued about your early engagement with Charles
Wilson; you had better explain the matter to him
and he will probably find as little cause for his jealousy
as, I assure you, there was for yours. Don’t
pout, dear Alice, you certainly <span class='it'>were</span> a little jealous
of me, but I only flirted harmlessly with your husband
<span class='it'>pour passer le temps</span>; and perhaps a little out of
revenge. I wanted to try whether a ‘<span class='it'>little dowdyish
red-nosed woman</span>’ could have any attractions for him.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jupiter! she must have been listening at the
door when I was discussing the subject of her ill-looks
just after her arrival,” exclaimed Mr. Wentworth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and mortified vanity will account for her
well-practised seductions, Harry,” said Alice; “but
let us hear the end of this precious epistle.” Mr.
Wentworth resumed:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope he has fallen into his old habits again and
is as fond and lover-like as I found him on my arrival.
One piece of advice I must give you, my sweet
Alice; do not trust him too much with those who
have greater powers of fascination than his little wife,
for believe me, he possesses a very susceptible nature.
Do not be such a good spouse as to show him
my letter. Remember I write to you with my usual
impudent frankness. Kiss little Harry for me and
remember me most kindly to your amiable husband.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“Ever your devoted friend and cousin,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:4em;margin-top:0.5em;'>“<span class='sc'>Agatha</span>.”</p>

</div>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“P.S. Can I send you any <span class='it'>nicknackery</span> from Paris?
I shall be delighted to be of service to you.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, that is as characteristic a letter as I ever
read,” exclaimed Wentworth as he flung it on the
table; “how adroitly she mingles her poison with her
sweetmeats; and how well she has managed to affix a
sting at the last: I wonder whom she has duped into
a marriage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Some foolish boy, doubtless, for she speaks of
him as being just of age, while she will never again
see her thirtieth summer,” said Alice; “but what
does she mean Harry about my early engagement
with Charles Wilson? He was a clerk to my
father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She told me a long story Alice about a proposed
elopement between you and this said Charles Wilson
which had been prevented by her interference.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good Heavens! Harry how she must have misrepresented
the affair. Wilson was in papa’s employ
and probably fancied it would be a good speculation
if he could marry his employer’s daughter. He became
exceedingly troublesome to me by his civilities,
and finally made love to me in plain terms, when I
communicated the whole affair to cousin Agatha, and
begged her to tell papa of it, because I was such a
child that I was ashamed to tell him myself. She did
so, and Wilson was dismissed; but I was then only a
school girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You seemed so agitated when she recurred to the
subject that I readily believed her story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was vexed, Harry, because she insinuated that
there was a likeness between our dear boy and that
vulgar fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How I have been deceived by a fiend in the form
of an angel,” exclaimed Wentworth; “we should
have been saved much suffering if she had never
entered our doors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed we should, Harry, and I shall never cease
to reproach myself for my folly in introducing such a
serpent into our Elysium.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your motives were kind and good, Alice; and
though it has been to you a severe lesson in the deceitfulness
of the world, and to me a still more painful
one in the deceitfulness of my own heart, yet, I
trust, that to both of us it may not be without its
salutary influences.”</p>

<div><h1><a id='app'></a>AN APPENDIX OF AUTOGRAPHS.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY EDGAR A. POE.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>In</span> our November and December numbers we gave
<span class='it'>fac-simile</span> signatures of no less than <span class='it'>one hundred and
nine</span> of the most distinguished American <span class='it'>literati</span>.
Our design was to furnish the readers of the Magazine
with a <span class='it'>complete</span> series of Autographs, embracing
a specimen of the MS. of <span class='it'>each of the most noted among
our living male and female writers</span>. For obvious
reasons, we made no attempt at classification or arrangement—either
in reference to reputation or our
own private opinion of merit. Our second article
will be found to contain as many of the <span class='it'>Dii majorum
gentium</span> as our first; and this, our third and last, as
many as either—although fewer names, upon the
whole, than the preceding papers. The impossibility
of procuring the signatures now given, at a
period sufficiently early for the immense edition of
December, has obliged us to introduce this Appendix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is with great pleasure that we have found our
anticipations fulfilled, in respect to the <span class='it'>popularity</span>
of these chapters—our individual claim to merit is
so trivial that we may be permitted to say so much—but
we confess it was with no less surprise than
pleasure that we observed so little discrepancy of
opinion manifested in relation to the hasty critical, or
rather gossiping observations which accompanied the
signatures. Where the subject was so wide and so
necessarily <span class='it'>personal</span>—where the claims of more
than one hundred <span class='it'>literati</span>, summarily disposed of,
were turned over for re-adjudication to a press so
intricately bound up in their interest as is ours—it is
really surprising how little of dissent was mingled
with so much of general comment. The fact, however,
speaks loudly to one point:—to the <span class='it'>unity of
truth</span>. It assures us that the differences which exist
among us, are differences not of real, but of affected
opinion, and that the voice of him who maintains
fearlessly what he believes honestly, is pretty sure to
find an echo (if the speaker be not mad) in the vast
heart of the world at large.</p>

<hr class='tbk126'/>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i109.jpg' alt='Signature of Chas. Sprague' id='iid-0004' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The “Writings of <span class='sc'>Charles Sprague</span>” were first
collected and published about nine months ago, by
Mr. Charles S. Francis, of New-York. At the time
of the issue of the book, we expressed our opinion
frankly, in respect to the general merits of the author—an
opinion with which one or two members of the
Boston press did not see fit to agree—but which, as
yet, we have found no reason for modifying. What
we say now is, in spirit, merely a repetition of what
we said then. Mr. Sprague is an accomplished
<span class='it'>belles-lettres</span> scholar, so far as the usual ideas of
scholarship extend. He is a very correct rhetorician
of the old school. His versification has not been
equalled by that of any American—has been surpassed
by no one, living or dead. In this regard there
are to be found finer passages in his poems than any
elsewhere. These are his chief merits. In the <span class='it'>essentials</span>
of poetry he is excelled by twenty of our countrymen
whom we could name. Except in a very few
instances he gives no evidence of the loftier ideality.
His “Winged Worshippers” and “Lines on the
Death of M. S. C.” are <span class='it'>beautiful</span> poems—but he has
written nothing else which should be called so. His
“Shakspeare Ode,” upon which his high reputation
mainly depended, is quite a <span class='it'>second-hand</span> affair—with
no merit whatever beyond that of a polished and
vigorous versification. Its imitation of “Collins’
Ode to the Passions” is obvious. Its allegorical
conduct is mawkish, <span class='it'>passé</span>, and absurd. The poem,
upon the whole, is just such a one as would have
obtained its author an Etonian prize some forty or
fifty years ago. It is an exquisite specimen of mannerism
without meaning and without merit—of an
artificial, but most inartistical style of composition,
of which conventionality is the soul,—taste, nature
and reason the antipodes. A man may be a clever
financier without being a genius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It requires but little effort to see in Mr. Sprague’s
MS. all the idiosyncrasy of his intellect. Here are
distinctness, precision, and vigor—but vigor employed
upon <span class='it'>grace</span> rather than upon its legitimate
functions. The signature fully indicates the general
hand—in which the spirit of elegant imitation and
conservatism may be seen reflected as in a mirror.</p>

<hr class='tbk127'/>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i111a.jpg' alt='Signature of Cornelius Mathews' id='iid-0005' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Cornelius Mathews</span> is one of the editors
of “Arcturus,” a monthly journal which has attained
much reputation during the brief period of its existence.
He is the author of “Puffer Hopkins,” a clever
satirical tale somewhat given to excess in caricature,
and also of the well-written retrospective criticisms
which appear in his Magazine. He is better known,
however, by “The Motley Book,” published some
years ago—a work which we had no opportunity of
reading. He is a gentleman of taste and judgment, unquestionably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is much to our liking—bold, distinct and
picturesque—such a hand as no one destitute of talent
indites. The signature conveys the hand.</p>

<hr class='tbk128'/>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i111b.jpg' alt='Signature of Charles Hoffman' id='iid-0006' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Charles Fenno Hoffman</span> is the author of
“A Winter in the West,” “Greyslaer,” and other
productions of merit. At one time he edited, with
much ability, the “American Monthly Magazine” in
conjunction with Mr. Benjamin, and, subsequently,
with Dr. Bird. He is a gentleman of talent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography is not unlike that of Mr. Matthews.
It has the same boldness, strength, and picturesqueness,
but is more diffuse, more ornamented and less
legible. Our <span class='it'>fac-simile</span> is from a somewhat hurried
signature, which fails in giving a correct idea of the
general hand.</p>

<hr class='tbk129'/>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i112.jpg' alt='Signature of Horace Greely' id='iid-0007' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Horace Greely</span>, present editor of “The Tribune,”
and formerly of the “New-Yorker,” has for
many years been remarked as one of the most able
and honest of American editors. He has written
much and invariably well. His political knowledge
is equal to that of any of his contemporaries—his
general information extensive. As a <span class='it'>belles-lettres</span>
critic he is entitled to high respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is a remarkable one—having about it a
peculiarity which we know not how better to designate
than as a <span class='it'>converse</span> of the picturesque. His
characters are scratchy and irregular, ending with
an <span class='it'>abrupt taper</span>—if we may be allowed this contradiction
in terms, where we have the <span class='it'>fac-simile</span> to
prove that there is no contradiction in fact. All
abrupt MSS., save this, have square or <span class='it'>concise</span> terminations
of the letters. The whole chirography
puts us in mind of a <span class='it'>jig</span>. We can fancy the writer
jerking up his hand from the paper at the end of each
word, and, indeed, of each letter. What mental
idiosyncrasy lies <span class='it'>perdu</span> beneath all this, is more than
we can say, but we will venture to assert that Mr.
Greely (whom we do not know personally) is, <span class='it'>personally</span>,
a very remarkable man.</p>

<hr class='tbk130'/>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i113a.jpg' alt='Signature of Prosper M. Wetmore' id='iid-0008' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The name of Mr. <span class='sc'>Prosper M. Wetmore</span> is familiar
to all readers of American light literature. He has
written a great deal, at various periods, both in prose
and poetry, (but principally in the latter) for our
Papers, Magazines and Annuals. Of late days
we have seen but little, comparatively speaking, from
his pen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is not unlike that of Fitz-Greene Halleck,
but is by no means so good. Its clerky flourishes
indicate a love of the beautiful with an undue straining
for effect—qualities which are distinctly traceable
in his poetic efforts. As many as five or six
words are occasionally run together; and no man
who writes thus will be noted for <span class='it'>finish</span> of style.
Mr. Wetmore is sometimes very slovenly in his best
compositions.</p>

“Life of the Saviour,” “Hints on Extemporaneous

<p class='pindent'>The name of <span class='sc'>William B. O. Peabody</span>, like that
of Mr. Wetmore, is known chiefly to the readers of
our light literature, and much more familiarly to
Northern than to Southern readers. He is a resident
of Springfield, Mass. His occasional poems have
been much admired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography is what would be called beautiful
by the ladies universally, and, perhaps, by a large
majority of the bolder sex. Individually, we think it
a miserable one—too careful, undecided, tapering,
and effeminate. It is not unlike Mr. Paulding’s, but
is more regular and more legible, with less force.
We hold it as undeniable that no man of <span class='it'>genius</span> ever
wrote such a hand.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Epes Sargent</span>, Esq., has acquired high reputation
as the author of “Velasco,” a tragedy full of beauty
as a poem, but not adapted—perhaps not intended—for
representation. He has written, besides, many
very excellent poems—“The Missing Ship,” for
example, published in the “Knickerbocker”—the
“Night Storm at Sea”—and, especially, a fine production
entitled “Shells and Sea-Weeds.” One or
two Theatrical Addresses from his pen are very
creditable <span class='it'>in their way</span>—but the way itself is, as we
have before said, execrable. As an editor, Mr. Sargent
has also distinguished himself. He is a gentleman
of taste and high talent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is too much in the usual clerk style to be
either vigorous, graceful, or easily read. It resembles
Mr. Wetmore’s but has somewhat more force.
The signature is better than the general hand, but
conveys its idea very well.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The name of <span class='sc'>Washington Allston</span>, the poet and
painter, is one that has been long before the public.
Of his paintings we have here nothing to say—except
briefly, that the most noted of them are not to our
taste. His poems are not all of a high order of merit;
and, in truth, the faults of his pencil and of his pen
are identical. Yet every reader will remember his
“Spanish Maid” with pleasure, and the “Address to
Great Britain,” first published in Coleridge’s “Sybilline
Leaves,” and attributed to an English author, is
a production of which Mr. Allston may be proud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. notwithstanding an exceedingly simple
and even boyish air, is one which we particularly
admire. It is forcible, picturesque and legible, without
ornament of any description. Each letter is
formed with a thorough distinctness and individuality.
Such a MS. indicates caution and precision, most
unquestionably—but we say of it as we say of Mr.
Peabody’s, (a very different MS.) that no man of
original genius ever did or could habitually indite it
under any circumstances whatever. The signature
conveys the general hand with accuracy.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/i116.jpg' alt='Signature of Alfred B Street' id='iid-0013' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Alfred B. Street</span> has been long before the
public as a poet. At as early an age as fifteen, some
of his pieces were published by Mr. Bryant in the
“Evening Post”—among these was one of much
merit, entitled a “Winter Scene.” In the “New-York
Book” and in the collections of American poetry
by Messieurs Keese and Bryant, will be found many
excellent specimens of his maturer powers. “The
Willewemoc,” “The Forest Tree,” “The Indian’s
Vigil,” “The Lost Hunter” and “White Lake” we
prefer to any of his other productions which have
met our eye. Mr. Street has fine taste, and a keen
sense of the beautiful. He writes carefully, elaborately,
and correctly. He has made Mr. Bryant his
model, and in all Mr. Bryant’s good points would be
nearly his equal, were it not for the sad and too perceptible
stain of the imitation. That he has imitated
at all—or rather that, in mature age, he has persevered
in his imitations—is sufficient warrantry for
placing him among the men of talent rather than
among the men of genius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is full corroboration of this warrantry. It
is a very pretty chirography, graceful, legible and
neat. By most persons it would be called beautiful.
The fact is, it is without fault—but its merits, like
those of his poems, are chiefly negative.</p>

<img src='images/i117.jpg' alt='Signature of R Penn Smith' id='iid-0014' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Richard Penn Smith</span>, although, perhaps,
better known in Philadelphia than elsewhere, has
acquired much literary reputation. His chief works
are “The Forsaken,” a novel; a pseudo-auto-biography
called “Colonel Crocket’s Tour in Texas;”
the tragedy of “Caius Marius,” and two domestic
dramas entitled “The Disowned,” and “The Deformed.”
He has also published two volumes of miscellanies
under the title of “The Actress of Padua and
other Tales,” besides occasional poetry. We are not
sufficiently cognizant of any of these works to speak
with decision respecting their merits. In a biography
of Mr. Smith, however, very well written by his
friend Mr. McMichael of this city, we are informed
of “The Forsaken,” that “a large edition of it was
speedily exhausted”—of “The Actress of Padua,”
that it “had an extensive sale and was much commended”—of
the “Tour in Texas,” that “few books
attained an equal popularity”—of “Caius Marius,”
that “it has great capabilities for an acting play,”—of
“The Disowned” and “The Deformed,” that they
“were performed at the London theatres, where they
both made a favorable impression”—and of his
poetry in general, “that it will be found superior to
the average quality of that commodity.” “It is by
his dramatic efforts,” says the biographer, “that his
merits as a poet must be determined, and judged by
these he will be assigned a place in the foremost rank
of American writers.” We have only to add that we
have the highest respect for the judgment of Mr.
McMichael.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Smith’s MS. is clear, graceful and legible, and
would generally be called a fine hand, but is somewhat
too clerky for our taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. <span class='sc'>Oliver Wendel Holmes</span>, of Boston, late Professor
of Anatomy and Physiology at Dartmouth College,
has written many productions of merit, and has
been pronounced, by a very high authority, the best
of the humorous poets of the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography is remarkably fine, and a quick
fancy might easily detect, in its graceful yet picturesque
quaintness, an analogy with the vivid drollery
of his style. The signature is a fair specimen
of the general MS.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Bishop Doane</span>, of New Jersey, is somewhat more
extensively known in his clerical than in a literary
capacity, but has accomplished much more than sufficient
in the world of books to entitle him to a place
among the most noted of our living men of letters.
The compositions by which he is best known were
published, we believe, during his professorship of
Rhetoric and Belles Lettres in Washington College,
Hartford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. has some resemblance to that of Mr.
Greely of “The Tribune.” The signature is far
bolder and altogether better than the general hand.</p>

<img src='images/i120.jpg' alt='Signature of Albert Pike' id='iid-0017' style='width:50%;height:auto;'/>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>We believe that Mr. <span class='sc'>Albert Pike</span> has never published
his poems in book form; nor has he written
anything since 1834. His “Hymns to the Gods,”
and “Ode to the Mocking Bird,” being printed in
Blackwood, are the chief basis of his reputation.
His lines “To Spring” are, however, much better in
every respect, and a little poem from his pen, entitled
“Ariel,” and originally published in the “Boston
Pearl,” is one of the finest of American compositions.
Mr. Pike has unquestionably merit, and that of a
high order. His ideality is rich and well-disciplined.
He is the most <span class='it'>classic</span> of our poets in the best sense
of the term, and of course his classicism is very different
from that of Mr. Sprague—to whom, nevertheless,
he bears much resemblance in other respects.
Upon the whole, there are few of our native writers
to whom we consider him inferior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. shows clearly the spirit of his intellect.
We observe in it a keen sense not only of the beautiful
and graceful but of the picturesque—neatness,
precision and general finish, verging upon effeminacy.
In force it is deficient. The signature fails to convey
the entire MS. which depends upon masses for its
peculiar character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. <span class='sc'>James McHenry</span>, of Philadelphia, is well
known to the literary world as the writer of numerous
articles in our Reviews and lighter journals, but,
more especially, as the author of “The Antediluvians,”
an epic poem which has been the victim of
a most shameful cabal in this country, and the subject
of a very disgraceful pasquinade on the part of
Professor Wilson. Whatever may be the demerits,
in some regard, of this poem, there can be no question
of the utter want of fairness and even of common
decency which distinguished the Phillipic in
question. The writer of a <span class='it'>just</span> review of the “Antediluvians”—the
only tolerable American epic—would
render an important service to the literature
o his country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. McHenry’s MS. is distinct, bold and simple,
without ornament or superfluity. The signature

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Richard Adams Locke</span> is one among the few

Of the “Moon Hoax” it is supererogatory

<p class='noindent'>if, in short, we are to judge of the value of a literary
composition in any degree by its <span class='it'>effect</span>—then was
the “Hoax” most precious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Mr. Locke is also a poet of high order. We
have seen—nay more—we have heard him read—verses
of his own which would make the fortune of
two-thirds of our poetasters; and he is yet so modest
as never to have published a volume of poems. As
an editor—as a political writer—as a writer in general—we
think that he has scarcely a superior in
America. There is no man among us to whose
sleeve we would rather pin—not our <span class='it'>faith</span> (of that
we say nothing)—but our <span class='it'>judgment</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is clear, bold and forcible—somewhat

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>Ralph Waldo Emerson</span> belongs to a class of
gentlemen with whom we have no patience whatever—the
mystics for mysticism’s sake. Quintilian
mentions a pedant who taught obscurity, and who
once said to a pupil “this is excellent, for I do not
understand it myself.” How the good man would
have chuckled over Mr. E! His present <span class='it'>rôle</span>
seems to be the out-Carlyling Carlyle. <span class='it'>Lycophron
Tenebrosus</span> is a fool to him. The best answer to his
twaddle is <span class='it'>cui bono?</span>—a very little Latin phrase very
generally mistranslated and misunderstood—<span class='it'>cui
bono?</span>—to whom is it a benefit? If not to Mr.
Emerson individually, then surely to no man living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His love of the obscure does not prevent him, nevertheless,
from the composition of occasional poems
in which beauty is apparent <span class='it'>by flashes</span>. Several of
his effusions appeared in the “Western Messenger”—more
in the “Dial,” of which he is the soul—or
the sun—or the shadow. We remember the
“Sphynx,” the “Problem,” the “Snow Storm,”
and some fine old-fashioned verses entitled “Oh fair
and stately maid whose eye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His MS. is bad, sprawling, illegible and irregular—although
sufficiently bold. This latter trait may
be, and no doubt is, only a portion of his general
affectation.</p>

general view of his merits. His orations, reviews,
and other compositions all evince the cultivated
belles-lettres scholar, and man of intellect and taste.
To high genius he has about the same claim as Mr.
Sprague, whom in many respects he closely resembles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His chirography is unusually rambling and school-boyish—but
has vigor and precision. It has no
doubt been greatly modified by adventitious circumstances,
so that it would be impossible to predicate
anything respecting it.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>[“Dorchester” was a beautiful little country town on the banks of the river Keawah, now Ashley, about twenty miles
from the city of Charleston, in South Carolina. It was chiefly settled by New Englanders. For a time it flourished and
became a market town of some importance. The planters of the neighborhood were generally persons of substance,
who lived in considerable state, and exercised the virtues of hospitality in an eminent degree; but with the war of the
Revolution, in which it suffered greatly, it began to decline, and its only remains now are the ruins of its church and the
open walls of the old British fort. From a memorandum which I made during a visit to the spot in 1833, I take the following:—“The
fort made of tapis—works still in considerable preservation—the wood-work alone decayed—the magazine
in ruins—and the area overgrown with plum trees. The church still standing—the steeple shattered by lightning,
and the wooden interior torn out—the roof beginning to decay at the ends of the rafters. It will probably fall in before
very long.” This prediction was not permitted to be verified. The fabric, I learn, has since been utterly destroyed by
an incendiary. Dorchester was distinguished by several actions of partisan warfare during the Revolution It was, by
turns, a military depot of the Carolinians and the British. These particulars will explain the little poem which follows.]</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>One</span> church and three dwelling houses, occupied
by bishops, had already been torn down to supply
material for the magnificent palace which the Duke
of Somerset was erecting for himself in the Strand,—a
sacrilege which the populace were beginning to
feel and resent, in a manner which threatened some
disturbance to the public peace. A rumor went
abroad that the Duke’s workmen had received his
commands to repair to Westminster on a certain day,
in order to pull down the Church of St. Margaret’s,
and add its materials to those already so boldly
wrested from their sacred purposes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gray of a summer’s morning was yet hanging
over the city, when a large number of workmen, each
wearing the Lord Protector’s badge, gathered in detached
parties about the Abbey. These men had been
employed in the destruction of St. Mary’s Church but
a few days before, and their coarse vestments were
torn and covered with the lime and dust which they
had brought from the ruin, a mark of their late sacrilegious
employment, which brought upon them many
a bitter taunt and frowning look from the wayfarers,
even before they entered the parish of Westminster.
So great was the manifestation of public resentment,
that each band of workmen, as it went along, drew
close together, and exhibited the pickaxes, crowbars,
and other heavy tools of iron with which they were
armed, like soldiers compelled on an irksome duty,
but resolute to perform it. These men gathered
slowly around the Abbey, and waited for a larger
body of working-men, who were expected to leave
their employment in the Strand and come to their
assistance in a force and number that might awe
the people into quiet submission to the injustice of
their lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning wore on, but they still lingered about
the church, trifling with their heavy tools and talking
together with some degree of anxiety, for the expected
aid had not yet arrived, and each instant the
streets and angles about the Abbey became more and
more thronged with sullen and discontented men, all
with lowering brows and flashing eyes, bent menacingly
upon them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still the crowd increased. Men hurried to and fro
eagerly and with cloudy looks. The workmen gradually
gathered in a close phalanx about the little
church, whispered anxiously together, and brandished
their tools with a faint show of defiance, yet seemed
afraid or reluctant to level them against the sacred
pile which stood among that mass of eager human
beings in the cool morning light, quiet and tranquil
as the spirit of holiness that brooded over its altar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Though the persons gathered about St. Margaret’s
were considerable in numbers, they were not yet
condensed into a form that could justly be termed a
mob. The streets were alive, but not yet blocked up
with people. Men, and even women, might pass to and
fro on ordinary business without much fear of injury
or interruption, but with a certainty of being jostled
and pushed about by the scattered stream of human
life that flowed toward the cathedral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the neighborhood of St. Margaret’s was in
this unusual state, two females, followed by more
than an equal number of serving-men, each with the
Lord Protector’s badge upon his sleeve, came suddenly
round a corner, and, before they seemed aware of it,
were encompassed by the crowd, through which it
seemed each instant more difficult to make a free
passage. The two females were muffled in their
mantles, with the hoods drawn so closely that it
was difficult to distinguish their features, or gather
an idea of their station, save by a certain air of dignity
and refinement which hung about the shorter of
the two, and which no vestments could entirely conceal.
Both this lady and her companion seemed
bewildered and terrified by the rush of human beings
with which they had become so strangely mingled. At
first they attempted to retrace their steps, but the
street through which they had come was now blocked
up by a company of more than two hundred
working-men, who were coming up from their employment
on the Strand, to assist in the destruction
of St. Margaret’s. When thus convinced that all
hopes of retreat were cut off, the female who had
seemed most anxious to escape the crowd, put forth
a white and trembling hand from beneath her mantle
and drew the hood still more closely over her face,
while the other in her fright allowed the drapery to
fall back from her head and exposed the features of
an elderly woman slightly wrinkled, and at the moment
pale as a corpse with apprehension. Her sharp
black eyes were keen with terror, and her wrinkled
hands shook in a way that rendered the effort to draw
her hood forward one of considerable difficulty. The
servitors who followed these bewildered persons
were but little annoyed by the position which
seemed so painful to them, but one, a tall insolent
man, held up his arm that all might see the Lord
Protector’s badge, and ordered those immediately
around him to make way for a noble lady of the
Duke’s household to pass. He spoke loud and arrogantly,
but the muffled female grasped his arm, and
while her words came gaspingly from excess of fear,
muttered—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dost thou not see how these men lower and frown
upon us already? Hearest thou not my noble father’s
name bandied from lip to lip, and each time with a
curse coupled with it? Take down thy arm, good
Richard—muffle the sleeve within thy cloak and
let us struggle forward as we are best able.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The serving-man hastened to obey this direction,
and wrapped his arm in the short cloak which
had been allowed to float back from his shoulder.
This act was performed the more promptly as a score
of burning eyes had flashed back a stern admonition
of danger when challenged by the Somerset badge
thus ostentatiously uplifted in their midst. Even as
it was, the man’s temerity might have been followed
by violent consequences, but that a deeper and more
general object of resentment presented itself in the
body of workmen that had made its way up from the
Strand through the cross street which our little party
had left but a moment before, and now flung itself
impetuously into the excited crowd. The moment
these men were seen pushing their way towards
their brethren gathered about St. Margaret’s, shouting
defiance and pushing the citizens about with their
heavy iron-tools, the spirit of discord broke loose
like a wild beast from his cage. A hoarse shout
thundered through the air. The hitherto stern and
silent multitude swayed round and plunged forward,
a mass of enraged, reckless, human life, eager to
trample down the body of men who came among
them armed to do sacrilege on the holy temple of their
worship. When the first fierce cry of their onset
swept over the females whose movements we have
recorded, the one whose features were yet concealed
grasped her companion’s arm, and, shrieking with
affright, sprang wildly on one side, forcing a passage
to the steps of a dwelling-house, where she sunk at
the foot of a granite pillar, panting like a wounded
fawn beneath the drapery which still concealed her
person. Her attendants strove to follow her but were
swept away by the rushing multitude, and, spite of
their struggles, forced into the <span class='it'>mêlée</span> raging between
the citizens and the Somerset workmen. These men
fought their way valiantly. Keeping in a compact
body they resolutely cleared a path through the unarmed
mob with their heavy crowbars and pickaxes,
which proved most effective weapons of defence.
The people goaded to fury by opposition rushed
madly upon them, strove to wrest away their weapons
by brute force, and when that failed tore up the pavement
and hurled the massive stones furiously into
their midst. Many were wounded, more than one
dropped down dead, crushed beneath the deadly missiles
which filled the air. The sweet breath of morning
was made terrible by the groans and cries and
harsh sounds of hot-blooded men, goaded to fury
and fierce with a thirst for strife, which threatened
to deluge the torn pavements with blood and carnage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The band of workmen which had already reached
St. Margaret’s at first essayed to aid their companions
but it was impossible even to penetrate the mob of
citizens which separated the two parties, and they
returned to their station before the church, which
the mob, in its blind eagerness to attack the larger
and more obnoxious party, had left almost entirely at
their mercy. Still their numbers were small, and
the enraged people so near at hand that but the lifting
of an implement of destruction would have placed
them in imminent peril. So they remained inactive,
contenting themselves with a hope that Somerset,
the Lord Protector, would hear of the riot and come
to his people’s rescue. Still the fight raged on, the
workmen were driven back, step by step, to a cross
street whence they had emerged, and which their
numbers choked up, forming a solid front, narrow
and compact, which the assailants found impossible
to break and difficult to contend against, as few had
the hardihood to come within the sweep of those
heavy iron bars which were never wielded but they
crushed some human being to the earth. While the
workmen maintained this position the assailants
were compelled to abate the fury of their attack.
The scene of strife too had been considerably removed
from the first place of encounter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young female, who is the especial object of
our interest, crouched at the base of the granite pillar
where she had sought refuge, shuddering and sick
with fear, amid this tumult of strife and terrible passions
raging about her. She heard the shrieks and
howling cries of the multitude as they struggled together,
heard them tear up the pavement with curses,
and felt the air tortured into unnatural currents as
the heavy stones whirled fiercely over her head.
Still she neither shrieked nor moved a limb, but clung
with a shuddering clasp to the pillar, helpless and
almost stupefied with terror. While the fight raged
fiercest about her she remained unnoticed, for even
there, amid that throng of men tugging at each other’s
throats and wrangling like wild animals together,
females were to be seen fighting and eager for strife—the
most relentless among the throng. In this terrible
mingling of sexes and strife of angry passions, a
helpless and prostrate female, shrinking from a
scene too horrible even for her imagination, might
well have been overlooked. All were too fiercely
occupied to offer her protection or insult. But as the
scene of strife became more distant the dense crowd
around her was scattered, and more than one of the
rude persons who hang about the skirts of a riotous
mob from idle curiosity or in hopes of plunder, observed
the deathly stillness of her position. There
was a delicacy in the small white hand and rounded
arm which clung to the pillar, exposed by the falling
drapery and flung out in beautiful relief upon the stone
as if a limb of exquisite sculpture had been chiselled
there. But the persons who gazed were too rude
for thoughts of beauty though so strangely betrayed. A
cluster of brilliants that blazed on one of the fingers,
and the rich drapery that lay in a picturesque heap
over her whole person, conveyed hopes of rich plunder,
and many a covetous eye twinkled with expectation
that when the crowd were drawn to a distance
she might be left helpless and exposed to their rapacity.
At last an artisan or mechanic of the lowest
order ascended the steps where she had sought
refuge, and, apparently heedless of her presence, sat
down on the opposite side of the pillar, so near that
his dusty leathern jerkin almost touched the arm still
wound immovably around it. He now uncovered
his head and wiped the perspiration from a low and
disagreeable forehead with the sleeve of his jerkin,
pushed back a mass of coarse hair that had fallen
over his eyes, and was about replacing his cap, when
a flash of sunshine fell upon the cluster of brilliants
which gemmed one of the fingers just in a range with
his eye. A look of coarse delight came to his repulsive
features, a cunning avaricious joy disagreeable
beyond description. He cast an eager look upon the
throng, which was still great, and toyed with his cap,
waving it up and down with both hands carelessly as
if to cool his face when any person seemed especially
regarding him. At last, when the general attention
was drawn another way by a party of horsemen
coming at a hard gallop down the street, he, as if by
accident, held his cap so as to conceal his face from
the multitude, and drew back slowly till the pillar
half concealed him, then, softly removing the hand
from its clasp on the stone, he drew the ring away
quick as lightning, and grasping it in his rough palm
allowed the little hand to fall down cold and lifeless
upon the step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Plunder from the dead is free to the first comer,”
he muttered, replacing his cap, “a woman completely
killed or in a swoon is the same thing, and one or the
other state belongs to this dainty lady, I take it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he muttered these words, the plunderer sauntered
with a heavy idle swagger down the steps, and
would have mingled with the crowd, but at that moment
an elderly man, evidently the servitor of some
noble family, paused by the steps, glanced at the recumbent
figure, and hastily inquired who the person
was, and why no assistance had been rendered. The
artisan, to whom he addressed himself as the nearest
person, was suddenly taken with a decided and absorbing
interest in the struggle that still raged farther
down the street, and, when the question had been
thrice repeated, only withdrew his attention long
enough to declare that he was quite ignorant regarding
the lady so strangely situated, and, in truth, had
observed her for the first time when pointed out by
the worshipful questioner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new comer ran hastily up the steps, flung
back the mantle which had fallen over her face, and
revealed the features of a young girl, pale as death,
and lying cold and lifeless close to the pillar. A flood
of rich chestnut-brown hair had broken loose, and the
string of rough emeralds that had confined it lay
broken and scattered among the folds of her dress.
The man seemed to recognize those sweet features,
for he turned pale, and an exclamation, almost of
terror, broke from his lips. “She is dead!” he cried
in a voice of keen emotion—“her hands are cold as
ice. What shall I say to my poor lord—who will
dare tell him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then she has taken leave within a short space
of time,” muttered the artisan, who stood with his
back toward the pillar, gazing intently afar off, as if
he had some heavy stake which the contest would
decide. “I can swear that her hand trembled as I
pulled off the ring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the love of heaven, is there no one here who
will call assistance!” exclaimed the new comer,
kneeling down and raising the senseless lady with
his arm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I do anything?” inquired the artisan, gruffly,
as if aroused to a consciousness that the fainting lady
required some attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, good friend, yes—run, I beseech
you for the nearest leech, or rather look out my
Lord Dudley, who has just ridden by; say to him
that a lady whose welfare is dear to him, has
swooned in the street, and is in danger from the mob.
Go, good man, go at once, or I fear me our blithesome
lady will never smile again!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay,” said the artisan, who had fixed a greedy
eye on the emeralds scattered over the lady’s dress.
“As I may not know the Lord Dudley when he is
found, had you not better leave the poor lady to me
while you seek him out yourself; the more especially
as you may see that her mouth is red again,
and there is a tear breaking through the thick eye-lashes
that were so black and still when you first
uncovered her face. The air has done her good.
Leave her to me, and by the time you come back with
the gentleman you wot of she will be well again.
Truly, my jerkin is none of the cleanest,” he added in
reply to a glance which the other had cast on his mean
raiment, “nor my face much to your liking, I see;
but I shall not run off with your dainty trouble there,
not being fool enough to cumber myself with anything
of womankind, be she gentle or simple, so you
can trust me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something in the artisan’s manner more
than in his appearance—and that was suspicions
enough, that rendered the person he addressed reluctant
to trust a being so helpless to his charge. He
hesitated and was deliberating how to act, when the
multitude came rushing back to their old station near
the church, shouting fiercely and uttering terrible
imprecations on the Duke of Somerset, who had sent
a large body of armed men up the Thames, who
had landed at the foot of Westminster Bridge, resolute
to support his artisans in the destruction of St.
Margaret’s. It was the first charge of this party, as
it joined the body of workmen, which still defended
the passage up St. Margaret’s street, that sent the
crowd rushing back upon the church. The small band
of horsemen which had just passed, wheeled suddenly
round and came back almost by compulsion, for their
way was entirely blocked up by the populace, and
behind were the Somerset men, urged to fierce
resentment, and goading them on to madness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The leader of this equestrian band—for it evidently
belonged to neither of the contending parties—was a
young and remarkably handsome man, who seemed
entangled with the crowd by accident, and only
desirous of continuing his morning ride in tranquillity.
The magnificent trappings of his black charger—the
jewelled buckle which fastened the plumes on his
cap, leaving a fine open forehead and a mass of light
curling hair exposed to view. The short cloak of dark
green velvet bordered with gold—the slashed and
pointed doublet and hose underneath, betrayed him as
one of the brightest and most noble ornaments of the
young King Edward’s court, and were all in striking
contrast with the rude mob from which he was deliberately
striving to extricate himself. He was followed
by a number of retainers well mounted, and
all wearing his family badge; yet it was not till they
were forced to retrace their way and made some
slight commotion in the crowd in wheeling their
horses, that the tumultuous populace seemed to
recognize them. But when the leader was known,
those men not actively engaged in the fight, pressed
back to give him way, and greeted him with uncovered
heads—a few flung their caps in the air, calling
out for those in advance to make room for the
Lord Dudley; others took up the cry, and then went
up a loud eager shout of</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Warwick! a Warwick! room, room for a
Warwick!” Thus sounding a defiance to the Somerset
battle-cry, that rang so fiercely up from the distance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This recognition by the mob seemed to annoy the
object of their clamor beyond measure. He lifted
his hand with an imperative motion, in a vain effort to
silence their noisy greeting; but when he saw that this
was mistaken for encouragement, and that his family
name rang louder and with more joyous acclamation
above all the tumult, he bent his noble head to
the multitude with forced resignation, and strove more
resolutely to retreat from a scene, which from many
causes, filled him with anxiety and regret. More than
once his high spirit was so chafed by the notice
which he had unwillingly obtained, that nothing but
compassion for the multitude seemed to prevent him
giving a free rein to the noble beast which shook
his head, champed angrily his tightened bit, and curveted
with impatience among the mass of human
beings that scarcely gave his hoofs free play upon the
pavement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two men whom we left near the young female,
who was just returning to animation, were interrupted
in their discussion by these two sources of
renewed commotion which we have just related, and
when the cry of “a Warwick, a Warwick,” swept
by, the last comer, who was still supporting the
lady, started to his feet, placed a hand over his eyes
to shade them from the sun, and looked earnestly
over the sea of human heads rising and falling and
flowing by, like the motion of a forest when the
wind sweeps over it. All at once he uttered an
exclamation of pleasure, and rushing down the steps,
forced his way to the young horseman who was now
almost opposite the place he had occupied. Pushing
eagerly through the crowd which surrounded the
struggling charger, he seized him by the bit, as the
only means of attracting the rider’s attention in a
scene where his voice was exerted in vain; but so
great was the tumult that even this method proved
ineffectual, and it was not till he had flung the beast
almost upon his haunches that he was recognized
by the anxious nobleman. The young man bent his
head, for the eager face of his retainer startled him,
though the words he would have uttered were swept
away by the thousand fierce sounds that filled the air.
At last, by the aid of gesture and such broken words
as reached his master’s ear, the man made himself
understood. The horseman started upright in his
stirrups, cast a keen look toward the spot pointed out
by his attendant, and, heedless of all former caution,
plunged his spurs into the restless charger, which
reared and plunged with a violence that sent the
people back upon each other, and cleared a space of
some yards about him. Regardless of consequences,
the nobleman scarcely gave his horse time to recover
himself, but urged him through the frightened crowd
with an impetuosity that sent a shower of sparks
about his hoofs when they struck upon the lower-most
of the stone flags where the lady had taken
shelter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man sprang from his saddle, and pushing
aside the artisan who still hung about her, took
the now partially recovered lady in his arms, and in
a voice of hurried and anxious affection inquired it
she were hurt, and multiplied questions one upon
another, mingling them with broken expressions of
tenderness, which she could only answer by sobs
and the profuse tears that rushed over her burning
cheeks. She seemed entirely overcome with joy at
his presence, and the intense shame arising from her
extraordinary situation. All his questions only served
to make her weep the more bitterly; but she clung
nervously to his hand, trembling between the pleasure
of his protection and the fear that he might
condemn her, and besought him, in broken tones, to
take her home, to forgive her, but, above all things,
to help her away from the mob of coarse rough
faces that were gazing upon her humiliation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, compose yourself,” said Dudley, in those
low and persuasive tones best calculated to allay her
nervous excitement, “are you not safe with me?
you are too feeble to move yet. In a little time I
trust that we may pass in safety, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me, my lord,” interrupted the man who
had informed his master of the lady’s plight. “If her
ladyship can find strength to walk, had we not better
remove her at once to a place of safety? It is yet
possible to make our way round the corner, and so
into the Park.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lord Dudley looked upon the crowd and
shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“See, my lord,” said the man still more earnestly,
“the people are becoming more turbulent than ever—in
less than five minutes the space between this
and the church will be crowded full again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I fear she is too weak for the attempt,” replied
Dudley, looking down with tender anxiety into the
sweet troubled face lifted with an expression of timid
confidence to his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, I am quite strong now; I can walk very
well if you are with me,” said the young girl; but
her pale and trembling lips belied the words as she
turned her back to the people and strove with unsteady
hands to gather the scattered masses of her
hair beneath the hood, which scarcely served to conceal
its rich beauty, dishevelled and loose as it was.
“See, I am quite ready,” she added, wrapping the
mantle about her, and gathering courage beneath the
concealment of its folds, and clinging to the young
nobleman’s arm she stood terrified, it is true, but
willing to submit herself to his guidance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My poor bird, how it pants and trembles beneath
my arm,” murmured Dudley. And amid all the annoyance
of his position, his heart thrilled with a
sense of the protection which it gave to the object
of his love; but the feeling gave way to one of keen
anxiety; for the populace were by this time assailed
so fiercely by the Somerset men that it was giving
way before them, and rapidly condensing itself
around the Abbey, which threatened soon to become
the scene of contention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What can be done? which way shall we go?”
said Dudley, appealing to his attendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The man looked around and gravely shook his
head. “I see no plan of escape unless we struggle
through the crowd,” he replied despondingly, “and
yet there is but your lordship and my humble self to
protect the Lady Jane, and the press threatens to be
great.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The artisan who had made a show of holding
Dudley’s horse, while he concealed the ring and as
many of the jewels which had dropped from the
lady’s hair as he could purloin during the short time
that she had been left alone with him, in the sleeve
of his jerkin—now slipped the bridle over his arm,
and came up the steps so far as its length would
permit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I might advise, fair sir,” he said, doffing his
cap, and concealing a large emerald that had before
escaped him, with his foot, as he spoke. “If I might
make bold to give an opinion, three stout men are
enough to cover the retreat of one woman any day.
Your gallant self and my worshipful friend here, to
say nothing of the man before you, who lacks not
both tough bone and sinew in a fair fight, and the
noble horse, which I take it, is worth at least two
men, having a fine knack, as I but now witnessed, of
scattering a crowd with his hoofs. Well now, fair
sir, supposing you mount this noble nag and push
a way through the crowd, while my worshipful
friend and humble self follow at his heels with the
lady between us. Oh, this does not jump with the
lady’s humor, I see,” continued the man without
breaking the thread of his speech, as the Lady Jane
drew closer to her companion and murmured in an
affrighted voice, “no, no Dudley—keep you with
me or I shall die with terror else.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dudley answered by a gentle pressure of the arm
clinging to his, and the man went on, as we have
said, regardless of the interruption.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, if she does not fancy the cut of my face,
perhaps the black charger there will have better
taste. Shall I mount and clear a path for you? It
is not often that I sit on a crimson saddle with housings
of velvet and gold—but there is an old saying
or a new one, it matters not which, that if you ‘put
a beggar on horseback he will ride’—I must not say
exactly where in the presence of this lady, but to
such a journey a passage through this crowd of
hooting scoundrels would be child’s play—shall I
mount, fair sir? you see the fight is getting nearer
and there will be hot work anon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the man finished speaking, he dropped his
sheepskin cap quite by accident, and displayed considerable
awkwardness in picking it up again. For
a person rather shabbily dressed he certainly was
somewhat fastidious in replacing it jauntily on one
side of his head; but in the process a large emerald
was sent, with a dexterous movement of the fingers,
flashing down the sleeve of his jerkin, which probably
had some connection with this elaborate display
of taste.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At any other time Dudley would have rebuked the
fellow’s boldness, but he was too anxious for thoughts
of station or dignity, and turning from the rude
speaker to his attendant, he demanded earnestly if his
plan were practicable. Before the person addressed
could reply, an immense paving stone was hurled by
his temple, and, tearing off the artisan’s cap in its
progress, was dashed to pieces against the granite
pillar which had so long sheltered the Lady Jane
Saymore. A shriek burst from her pale lips, and
every face in that little group turned white as death.
After a moment the artisan took up his cap, and
thrusting his hand through a hole cut in it by the
stone, tried to convince himself and those about him,
by a broad laugh, that he was a man of decided
courage and not to be daunted by trifles that could
drive the blood from a nobleman’s cheek; but his
voice died in the miserable attempt, and he slunk
down to the horse’s head again, for the moment subdued
into silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the love of heaven, let us be gone,” said
Lord Dudley, terrified by the danger which threatened
the object of his love. “Mount, fellow; and if you
clear a way for this lady, you shall have gold”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before he could finish the sentence, the artisan
sprang to a seat on the gorgeous saddle, and striking
his mutilated cap down upon his head with one hand,
drew up the bridle, and shouting, “Make room for
the noble Dudley—a Warwick, a Warwick,” plunged
into the crowd.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dudley threw his arm firmly round the Lady Jane,
and directing his attendant to keep close on the other
side, followed his strange conductor, who proved an
excellent guide; for in his appeal now to the people
in behalf of their favorite noble, now to the Somerset
men as one of their number, he succeeded in forcing
a passage for the party till they had almost reached
the front of St. Margaret’s; but here their position
became more dangerous than ever, for a detachment
of the Somerset men, after a desperate struggle to
force a passage through the body of people, had
found the way across a corner of the park and along
Prince’s street, almost within a stone’s throw of the
church, before their movement was discovered by
those resolute on its defence. It was in vain the
artisan pleaded for a passage now, his voice was overwhelmed
by the roar. He was raised considerably
above the crowd, and was among the first to discover
this new difficulty. He arose in the saddle, cast a
crest-fallen look over the sea of human heads that
surrounded him, then bending backwards, he addressed
the young lord and his companion in a voice
that was less steady than he would gladly have rendered
it—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the church, my lord—to the church at once!
The street is choked, as far as I can see—is choked
up with Somerset men; but they are mistaken if they
hope to reach St. Margaret’s; here are stout angry
fellows enough to keep them at bay till Michaelmas.
Seek shelter for the lady, fair Sir, before they all see
as much as I do, for there will be bloody work there,
or I am no reader of men’s faces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no time for parley or delay, the pale
craven face of the artisan bore witness to the truth
of what he said. Lord Dudley clasped his companion
more firmly, and forced his way with almost supernatural
strength toward the church. The artisan
would gladly have sought the shelter which he had
so wisely recommended to his noble companion; but
the horse had become restive under a strange guidance,
and before his head could be turned toward
St. Margaret’s, the mob had discovered the Somerset
workmen, and closed round him with a violence that
rendered a change of direction impossible. It was
in vain that he waved his cap, shouted Lord Dudley’s
name, and craved a free passage. His voice was
overwhelmed in the roar and rush of a conflict
more dreadful than had been witnessed that day.
The people saw the spoilers almost upon their consecrated
ground, and they fought like lions to protect
the sacred rest of their dead and the altar of their
worship. It was a just cause, but the strife a terrible
one indeed. So great was the press, that our
artisan found the motion of his horse cramped and
almost prevented. His limbs were crushed against
the noble animal till the pain became almost insupportable.
He would gladly have dismounted and have
taken his chance with the throng, but so dense was
the sea of human beings crowding upon him, that
there was not an inch of space through which he
might hope to reach the ground. So horse and rider
were violently borne forward at the mercy of the
crowd, and exposed to the shower of missiles that
now darkened the air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Meantime Dudley and his companions had reached
the door of St. Margaret’s; but it was closed, and a
company of armed men stood resolutely before it.
The little band of workmen, which had kept its station
there till within the last hour, had at length deserted
their post, terrified by this guard of armed
men added to the mob which they had so long braved.
Despairing of escape they had clambered, each as
he best might, up the gothic windows and rough
stone work of the little church, and were now
crouching in groups on the roof, and striving to conceal
themselves behind the small turrets or steeples
that surmounted its four corners, afraid of being detected
by the populace, who were each moment becoming
more and more exasperated by their brethren.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the name of heaven, good friends, allow me
to find shelter for this lady within the church,” exclaimed
Lord Dudley, as pale and fearfully agitated
he turned in despair from the bolted door which he
had reached in spite of the pikes presented by the
self-constituted guard, “I am a friend to the people,
and this lady”—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is his sister,” interrupted the attendant hastily,
well knowing that her true title would harden the
men’s hearts against her, though she was almost
lifeless, and only kept from sinking at their feet by
the strong arm of her noble protector.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, even our church may soon be no place
of safety,” said one of the men, “a few minutes
and this building where our parents worshipped—where
our children were baptised—may be a heap
of ruins like those of St. Mary. Our holy altar stones
may be made into door steps for the Duke of Somerset’s
fine palace—yes, our chancels sacked to yield
stones to flag his wine-cellars, while the bones and
sacred dust of our fathers are cast into the street,
and scattered to the four winds of heaven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dudley felt the gentle being, who clung to him for
safety, tremble and shrink, as if this angry speech
had been levelled at her alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that the people have suffered some
wrong,” he said, in a mild but unsteady voice, for
he was painfully agitated, both by his late struggle
with the crowd, and the torture which the man’s
impetuous speech was inflicting on his gentle charge.
“But let me beseech you, unclose the door, my—my
poor sister is well nigh sinking to the earth with
fatigue and terror.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still the men remained obstinate, not only refusing
to open the door, but guarding it with a close row of
levelled pikes. The sound of fierce strife, which
now arose with appalling violence, within a few
roods of the church, seemed to fill them with cold
and stubborn bitterness. At last, when a loud and
terrible cry swept over them—a cry of triumph from
the Somerset men, mingled with a yell of defiance
from the mob, in which Somerset, the Lord Protector’s
name, was winged by shouts and curses through
the dense air, the man who had spoken before
turned almost menacingly on the young nobleman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I not tell you,” he exclaimed, “this is no
place for a lady? If we cannot guard our dead, how
can your charge be safe? Hear that shout—the
Duke of Somerset is himself coming up from the
river to reinforce his band of pillagers. A curse light
upon his sacrilegious head for this day’s work—a
curse on him and his!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no, no; do not curse him!” exclaimed the
Lady Jane, starting from Dudley’s arm, and flinging
the hood back from her pale face with a wild impulse—“he
does not know—he has not thought how
dreadful all this is: you do not dream how kind he
is. In pity—for sweet mercy’s sake, do not curse
my father!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Her father,” exclaimed the men almost simultaneously,
and with menacing looks; “her father!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Dudley drew the young girl back to his side,
pulled the mantle almost roughly over her face, and
turned sternly upon the men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Behold,” he said, with a flashing eye, “behold
the effect of your cruel delay; my poor sister is
driven stark mad at last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The speech, and the pale steadfast features of
the young man, had the desired effect. The guard
did not open the door, it is true, but their manner
was more subdued, and they consulted in a low
voice together.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And if we unlock the church, what warrant have
we that you are not a partisan of the Duke’s?” said
the leader, glancing suspiciously at the young nobleman’s
rich vestments; “you may be of his household,
nay, his son, for aught we know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have the word of a Warwick, and this
proof that the pledge is not given without right,”
said the young man, flinging aside his velvet cloak,
and displaying the family crest, set in brilliants, on
his sword-hilt. “Now, sirs, let me pass! I have
no share in this broil, and would gladly have escaped
from it unknown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pass in, and heaven’s blessing go with you!”
said the man, almost angrily striking up the line of
weapons which his band still kept levelled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He unlocked the heavy door, and while the dense
mob shouted around him, eager to know why he
acted thus for a stranger, he stood, with uncovered
head, till the young nobleman had entered the church;
then, he closed the door again with a half repeated
blessing upon the lips that had been almost blistered
with imprecations a few moments before. The solemn
stillness and cool atmosphere, which pervaded
that little church, fell like a breath from heaven on
the three persons who entered it, weary and faint
from the turmoil that raged without.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blended hues of purple and gold and crimson,
shed from the stained and diamond-shaped glass that
filled the gothic windows, flooded the building with
a dim mellow light, and slept, in a rich haze, among
the funereal urns of snowy marble placed in the various
niches, once occupied by images of Catholic
worship. A shadowy light, such as beams from a
mild sunset, lay upon the altar-stone, which gleamed
out white and pure above the purple velvet that carpeted
its steps. A baptismal fount of marble stood
on the right hand filled with clear water; but in that
rich light it seemed almost brimming with wine. Two
censers of massive silver stood above the altar, but
only as remnants of a discarded faith, for no incense
had been kindled in their hearts since the divorce of
the late Henry and Catherine of Arragon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole church was pervaded with a beautiful
quiet, such as might reign in the shadowy dwellings
of paradise. Dudley yielded to its influence, and
drew a deep breath, half in awe, half in thankfulness,
as he gently placed the Lady Jane upon one of the
steps of the altar, and sprinkled her pale face with
the water which he dipped with his hand from the
baptismal fount. He took off the mantle which she
still unconsciously held tightly about her person, and
gathering up the rich tresses of her hair as they fell
upon the marble, made an awkward attempt to bind
them round her head. The poor lady was conscious
of his kindness, but so exhausted that she had no
power to thank him. The very effort to unclose her
eyes was an exertion too much for her languid state,
and the soft light which fell over her like a rich sunset
seemed lending beauty to a marble statue, so pale
and deathlike were her features. When Dudley inquired
with anxious tenderness after her welfare,
from time to time, she answered him with a faint
clasp of the hand which he took in his, and grateful
tears gushed in bright drops through her closed lashes,
and fell, one after another, like jewels upon the purple
velvet beneath her cheek. At last she opened
her eyes, a sweet and tender expression of pleasure
came to her face, and one of the familiar smiles
which Dudley loved so well sprang like sunlight to
her reddening lips. She was yet bewildered and
dreamy, but tranquillized by the one dear presence,
and the holy quiet which brooded over the place of
her rest. For a time she was unconscious of the
tumult which still raged without, for the sounds came
but faintly to that holy place, and seemed more like
the heaving beat of a far off ocean than a strife of
angry men, heated and drunken with bad passions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All at once a shout so long, loud and fierce, that it
filled that tranquil building like the howl of a demon,
fell upon her ear. She started up with a full consciousness
of all that had happened to her during the
morning, and again sinking upon the steps of the
altar buried her face between her hands, and held
her breath with a feeling of terror such as she had
never known before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that moment Dudley’s attendant, who had remained
near the church door, came hurriedly toward
his master with information that the Duke of Somerset
had joined his men in person, and was now within
a few paces of the church.</p>

<p class='line0'><span class='sc'>I sat</span> by the casement; before me there</p>
<p class='line0'>Lay a treasured thing, a long tress of hair,</p>
<p class='line0'>And it moved my heart with a touching power—</p>
<p class='line0'>’Twas the cherished gift of a parting hour.</p>
<p class='line0'>The sun-shine lay ’mid its nut-brown fold</p>
<p class='line0'>With a loving smile, as it did of old.</p>
<p class='line0'>When the curl waved free in its careless grace,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like a cloud in the sky, o’er the smiling face</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the gentle girl that I loved so well—</p>
<p class='line0'>A dimming tear on the bright lock fell</p>
<p class='line0'>As thoughts of the loved one far away,</p>
<p class='line0'>And the teeming past, on my sad heart lay.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>A Zephyr, that all this time had play’d,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like a laughing child, ’mid the rose tree’s shade,</p>
<p class='line0'>Flew up, like a bird, to the casement there,</p>
<p class='line0'>And bore off in triumph the lock of hair.</p>
<p class='line0'>’Twas a cruel theft! and harsh words of blame,</p>
<p class='line0'>Like a mountain stream, from my full heart came,</p>
<p class='line0'>For the reckless deeds of the careless thing,</p>
<p class='line0'>Ever hovering near on mischievous wing.</p>
<p class='line0'>But the day before, he had entered my bower,</p>
<p class='line0'>And scattered the leaves of its loveliest flower,</p>
<p class='line0'>And bore off a letter that lay unread,</p>
<p class='line0'>’Neath the scented buds, on a mossy bed,</p>
<p class='line0'>To the brook hard by, who, with dimpled cheek</p>
<p class='line0'>And a smothered laugh at the Zephyr’s freak,</p>
<p class='line0'>Received the gift, and bounded on</p>
<p class='line0'>As wild, and free, as a forest fawn,</p>
<p class='line0'>To its hiding spots ’neath the greenwood shade,</p>
<p class='line0'>Glancing back, through the leaves, where the young wind play’d.</p>
<p class='line0'>“Now! Spirit of Air,” I cried, “gay breeze—</p>
<p class='line0'>Are all thine acts as unkind as these?</p>
<p class='line0'>Thy wings are unfettered—thy path is free—</p>
<p class='line0'>Yet mine is the power to follow thee.”</p>
<p class='line0'>Then thought sprang up on her weariless wing,</p>
<p class='line0'>And tracked the wind, in imagining.</p>
<p class='line0'>He stole the white plume from the thistle’s crest,</p>
<p class='line0'>Which was light as down on the swan’s pure breast,</p>
<p class='line0'>And with waving wing bore the prize away</p>
<p class='line0'>To a happy group ’mid the flowers at play,</p>
<p class='line0'>And fanning the cheek of each laughing boy,</p>
<p class='line0'>With his cooling wing, waved the downy toy</p>
<p class='line0'>Their bright heads above, and the careless band,</p>
<p class='line0'>With eager eye, and with outstretched hand,</p>
<p class='line0'>Ran away, in chase of the silvery thing</p>
<p class='line0'>That the Zephyr bore on exulting wing.</p>
<p class='line0'>Now slowly it floated their hands beneath—</p>
<p class='line0'>Now upward it sprang on a stronger breath—</p>
<p class='line0'>Now wafted afar—’twas a merry race</p>
<p class='line0'>The Zephyr to lead, and the children in chase!</p>
<p class='line0'>He left them behind, but bore along</p>
<p class='line0'>Their glee-toned voices, in joyous song,</p>
<p class='line0'>And each lone mother looked up and smiled,</p>
<p class='line0'>As she caught the tones of her darling child,</p>
<p class='line0'>And paused awhile from her toil, to bless</p>
<p class='line0'>The heart, o’erflowing with happiness.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Then he went his way and on manhood’s brow</p>
<p class='line0'>His cooling fingers are busy now,</p>
<p class='line0'>He parts the dark hair from its resting place,</p>
<p class='line0'>And prints a kiss on the anxious face,</p>
<p class='line0'>And woos him to leave the dust and glare</p>
<p class='line0'>Of the crowded town, for a spot more fair,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where trees in blossom, and birds on wing,</p>
<p class='line0'>Lead the rapt heart from each worldly thing.</p>
<p class='line0'>But man heeds not, for his rest is sold,</p>
<p class='line0'>And his heart bows down to the god of gold;</p>
<p class='line0'>For the tempting Zephyr he “cares not a groat,”</p>
<p class='line0'>He is eagerly reaching a “ten pound note,”</p>
<p class='line0'>That ragged, and soiled on the counter doth lay,</p>
<p class='line0'>But the Zephyr indignantly bears it away.</p>
<p class='line0'>He toss’d it, he pull’d it, he twirled it around,</p>
<p class='line0'>Now high in the air, and now low on the ground,</p>
<p class='line0'>He moaned in derision, he whistled with glee,</p>
<p class='line0'>Ah! never was Zephyr as merry as he,</p>
<p class='line0'>Till at length, in his frolic, he entered a shed</p>
<p class='line0'>Where a widow was praying for daily bread,</p>
<p class='line0'>In the voice of faith, low, subdued and mild,</p>
<p class='line0'>She prayed for food for her starving child:</p>
<p class='line0'>Then the wind bowed down with its burden there,</p>
<p class='line0'>And Heaven thus answered the widow’s prayer.</p>
<p class='line0'>Then he entered the halls, where many a scene</p>
<p class='line0'>Of joyous pleasure, and mirth had been—</p>
<p class='line0'>He softly sighed o’er the festal board,</p>
<p class='line0'>Where the jest had passed, and the red wine poured,</p>
<p class='line0'>He swept the harp with his quivering wing,</p>
<p class='line0'>And woke the tones of each mournful string,</p>
<p class='line0'>While his murmuring voice, with its gentle chime,</p>
<p class='line0'>Seemed singing a song of the olden time,</p>
<p class='line0'>Or breathing a dirge o’er the gay hearts fled</p>
<p class='line0'>To their silent homes ’mid the lowly dead.</p>
<p class='line0'>He sighed through the banners that hung on high—</p>
<p class='line0'>(Dimmed was their gorgeous blazonry,)</p>
<p class='line0'>But they waved aloft, as they waved of old,</p>
<p class='line0'>When the shout and song shook each heavy fold,</p>
<p class='line0'>While the dust fell down in a darkening cloud—</p>
<p class='line0'>And the moth was rocked in her silken shroud—</p>
<p class='line0'>And the bat sprang forth from his loathsome nest,</p>
<p class='line0'>’Mid the pennons there, an unseemly guest!</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;Then he went to the violet’s lonely bowers,</p>
<p class='line0'>And gathered their breath, though he left the flowers,</p>
<p class='line0'>And hastened on with the rich perfume</p>
<p class='line0'>And a gladsome song, to the invalid’s room.</p>
<p class='line0'>He hushed his voice as he entered there,</p>
<p class='line0'>For holy and sad rose the sound of prayer,</p>
<p class='line0'>With his wealth from the woods he wafted on,</p>
<p class='line0'>And rushing memories of bright things gone</p>
<p class='line0'>To the dying bore, while a low-breathed sigh,</p>
<p class='line0'>Told of the Zephyr’s sympathy.</p>
<p class='line0'>One tender act that he did that day,</p>
<p class='line0'>Was a moment to pause where a stranger lay,</p>
<p class='line0'>In an unknown land, with no loved one near</p>
<p class='line0'>To breathe a sigh o’er his lowly bier,</p>
<p class='line0'>Or moisten his grave with the tear-drops shed</p>
<p class='line0'>From the mourning heart, o’er the loved and the dead.</p>
<p class='line0'>Then mounting upward, on breezy wing,</p>
<p class='line0'>To the white haw tree richly blossoming,</p>
<p class='line0'>And, gathering its sweets with a gentle wave,</p>
<p class='line0'>He spread them like snow o’er the stranger’s grave.</p>
<p class='line0'>Green leaf, and bud, and starry flower,</p>
<p class='line0'>Filled the rich air, like a lovely shower</p>
<p class='line0'>Of bright things, sent from a fairy land,</p>
<p class='line0'>And lay on the grave as though some kind hand</p>
<p class='line0'>Had scattered, that silent heart above,</p>
<p class='line0'>The sweets that in life it had learned to love.</p>
<p class='line'>&#160;</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>&ensp;&ensp;But ’twere <span class='it'>vain</span> to tell of his wanderings free</p>
<p class='line0'>O’er leafy land, and o’er foaming sea—</p>
<p class='line0'>How he swept round the palace, and played through the cot—</p>
<p class='line0'>Passed “the highest, the lowest, the loneliest spot;”</p>
<p class='line0'>How he wafted the purple of lordly pride,</p>
<p class='line0'>And fluttered the rags of the beggar aside,</p>
<p class='line0'>How he made of a spray-capped wave his steed,</p>
<p class='line0'>And rode o’er the ocean with Jehu speed,</p>
<p class='line0'>(’Till his charger tossed its snowy mane,</p>
<p class='line0'>And sank to its native depths again,)</p>
<p class='line0'>How he hastened the ship on her homeward way,</p>
<p class='line0'>And scattered her track with the ocean’s spray.</p>
<p class='line0'>’Twere vain to number the acts like these,</p>
<p class='line0'>That were done that day, by the joyous Breeze—</p>
<p class='line0'>While I could but mark that, what first seemed rude,</p>
<p class='line0'>Was gentle, and tender, and kind, and good.</p>
<p class='line0'>I followed him far on his wayward track,</p>
<p class='line0'>And when, from wandering, I turned me back,</p>
<p class='line0'>He whispered at parting, these words, methought,</p>
<p class='line0'>To my hasty heart,—“<span class='it'>Judge not!</span> <span class='sc'>judge not!</span>”</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THEODORE S. FAY, AUTHOR OF “NORMAN LESLIE,” “THE COUNTESS IDA,” ETC.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>It</span> is the fashion to consider Macbeth a spotless
and noble soul, ensnared by the toils of the fiends,
and pulled down from heaven to hell by the chance
meeting of the weird sisters on the heath. There is
a serious objection to this view. It makes machines
of men. It takes from us the most obvious and sublime
attribute of an immortal being, viz: free agency. If
a high-minded and God-revering mortal is unprotected
against the attacks of supernatural beings—if
foul witches may watch for him in unguarded moments,
and weave around his enchanted feet the
fatal snares of crime and death, then are we truly a
wretched race. But this is not Shakspeare’s creed.
This is not the character of the tragedy. Macbeth
was a villain. He had deliberately adopted vice as
his god long before the fiends were permitted to
patter with him. They come as a <span class='it'>consequence</span> not as
a <span class='it'>cause</span> of wickedness. The withered and wild sisters
on the blasted heath were conjured up by his
own cherished weaknesses and <span class='it'>secret</span> deeds.<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> They
were the haggard and hellish impersonations of his
own hidden thoughts and passions. He was not the
pure, generous, heaven-adoring person he is represented.
The germs of his guilt he had received into
his heart by himself years before, and they lay
shooting there in silence, only waiting the quickening
beam of opportunity—waiting the first, feeblest
temptation to start forth in all their force. He was
one of those fair-<span class='it'>seeming</span> men who pass for honest
and noble. The world contains now, as then, many
such. Many a man with an uplifted brow and a
clear name, waits only <span class='it'>occasion</span> to prove himself a
scoundrel. It is such specious hypocrites that gather
around them (as the smell of carrion does the hawk
and vulture) the plotting witches who watch for
power over the children of men. They had never
tempted the pure good old King Duncan. He might
have passed the blasted heath every day of his life,
and these hags would never have dreamed of appearing
to him. His soul was not prepared for their wiles.
But that of Macbeth—as well as that of his stern
wife—was corrupted by the whole tenor of their previous
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Had there been left no evidence of this, I should
still have asserted it. The innocent—the pure in
heart—they who daily commune with their Maker—who
acknowledge their weakness and danger
when left to themselves—and implore humbly at his
feet his all-sufficient aid—never fall victims to the
accursed fiends, whether they appear in the deformity
of Paddock and Graymalkin, or disguised
under the fair temptations of life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Shakspeare has left proof enough in his tragedy.
He meant to show, not (as is frequently
asserted) the downfall of noble grandeur and unsuspecting
innocence, but the destruction of a fair-showing,
unsuspected villain—the wreck of a ship
whose outward semblance was tall and imposing, but
which was unseaworthy and destined to go down
before the first gale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the first place, why does not <span class='it'>Banquo</span> suffer
from the fiends? He is with Macbeth when they
appear. He even boldly addresses them, and at once—with
the frank fearlessness of a noble and virtuous
mind, conscious of its honesty, commands them, if
they can read the future, to speak to <span class='it'>him</span> also.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear your favors,
nor your hate.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here is at once a man not to be tampered with.
They promise <span class='it'>him</span> also as well as Macbeth a dazzling
future good—a posterity of kings—but it in
no way changes his plans of life, or raises the least
idea in his mind of crime or intrigue. Even when,
according to the prediction of the witches, Macbeth
instantly receives intelligence, of his being thane of
Cawdor, Banquo’s <span class='it'>clear-seeing sense of right</span>, his
innocence of nature takes the true and virtuous view
of the affair, looks, at a glance, through all the complicated
web of the sisters’ plots, and keeps himself
unsoiled, unendangered by them.</p>

give charitable donations, and follow the career of a
flaming patriot or a meek saint, but the lady upon
whom he has conferred with his name, the right of
being with him continually, will be pretty able to tell
how matters really are. I do not say that, because
a wife abuses her husband and calls him names, he
must necessarily be a rascal; but, as a general rule,
the partner of his woes and joys has better opportunities
of <span class='it'>knowing the man</span> than almost any one
else—at least, if she be a person of Lady Macbeth’s
discrimination. Well then, see what his <span class='it'>lady</span> says

<p class='pindent'>That she should suppose him <span class='it'>too full of the milk

disclosed. Shakspeare somewhere else says, “It is
not a year or so that shows us a man”—and it is an
important truth, that we are not thoroughly known
by our best friends, and do not know ourselves till
late in life. This same person, so full of the milk of
human kindness that she feared his “softer nature”

<p class='pindent'>This passage has been often misunderstood. “Without

mean, thou art without the <span class='it'>vices</span> which should attend

with an <span class='it'>appearance of holiness</span>. He loves the <span class='it'>mask</span>
of virtue, but he loves also the sweets of sin. He
has thus far enjoyed the good opinion of the <span class='it'>world</span>.
He cannot bear to throw aside the wreath which he
has worn and which flatters his weakness and vanity.
It is the <span class='it'>world</span> which alone he thinks of. This is his
only god. Of the Supreme Being, there is not a
word; but of his inclination to assume the moral
responsibility there is a distinct acknowledgment:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here we have Macbeth’s character. Here we have
the secret of his goodness. It is <span class='it'>fear</span> and <span class='it'>love of the
world</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shakspeare meant to draw a very—very common
character, only he has made it colossal. How many
men in the common life of this day are irreproachable
from the same considerations—fear and love
of the world, joined to a certain dislike of the trouble,
exertion and risk of wrong. (“If we should fail!”)
That these are the moving springs of this seemingly
noble and generous but really remorseless and impious
character we see again from a remark of his
own. After contemplating the murder for some time,
he concludes to abandon the plan. Why? Because
he will not incur the moral guilt? Because he has
thoughts of his God, whose eye is on him, and who
cannot but punish a crime? Because the commandment
has been written, “Thou shalt do no murder?”
Because the Deity himself has decreed “blood for
blood?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No. For reasons much more suited to his irreligious,
infidel, worldly mind:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->

<p class='line0'>Which should be worn now in their newest gloss,</p>
<p class='line0'>Not cast aside so soon.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>These are his reasons for not wishing to proceed.
Not a thought of his Maker—not an allusion to a
future world. He expressly says, in another passage,
if he could but be secure against detection <span class='it'>in this
world</span>, he does not feel any apprehension respecting
the other. He’ll “<span class='it'>jump the world to come</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>No man, not corrupt by long previous backslidings
either of thought or deed, would act as Macbeth acts.
He grasps at the first idea of murder with the true
zest of an assassin. All his struggles are only those
of fear. The <span class='it'>first</span> time he meets the king, his generous,
grateful, and gracious master, he seems already
to have arranged the murder in his mind, and his
hypocrisy and cruelty do not waver an instant. He
discovers the self-possession and plausible villany of
a practised criminal, and this too before he sees his
wife upon the subject. It almost seems as if they
had spoken on this point before. When Duncan
heaps him with thanks and rewards, he answers:</p>

<p class='pindent'>These are not the thoughts of the gentle, happy-hearted

vainly striving to make head against God’s vengeance
by denying his existence. No. Life’s <span class='it'>not</span> a
walking shadow. It is more than a poor player—than
a tale signifying nothing. It signifies much not
to be known by the “ignorant present,” as they find,
unhappy lost ones, who mistake such wicked blasphemies
for truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pertinacity with which his selfish soul is
wedded to the world is again betrayed in one of his
last soliloquies, where, in running a kind of balance
in his accounts between the gains and losses of his
murderous ambition, he complains:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Always the world bounds his hopes and his fears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The original viciousness of his nature is also betrayed
by the readiness with which, once embarked
in the career of crime, he plunges in headlong. The
very morning of the murder of the king, he stabs in
their sleep the two grooms of the chamber, then
Banquo and Fleance (which latter escapes by chance.)
He rushes on from murder to murder with the rabid
fury of a hound maddened with the taste of blood.
He adopts the direst principles of action,</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Shakspeare meant to draw, in this remarkable
portraiture, a worldly character unsupported by <span class='it'>religion</span>,
is evident from the <span class='it'>tone of piety</span> which runs
through the other characters. The gentlewoman’s
“Heaven knows what she has known,” and her
“pray God it be well.” The doctor’s “God, God
forgive us all!” Macduff’s</p>

<p class='line0'>Fell slaughter on their souls: Heaven rest them now.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class='pindent'>This is the oft repeated apprehension of a pious
heart which fears still its own weakness, and finds,
in the inscrutable and most awful visitatings of God
a merited blow—a chastener of its still corrupt desires—a
lesson to unlink it yet more from its grasp
on mortality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately again Macduff prays to heaven—and
in the same page Malcolm says:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another instance of the pure christian piety with
which the poet invests his good characters, and of
which he deprives his bad ones, telling strongly for
Dr. Ulrici’s theory, occurs in the third scene of the
fourth act, where Malcolm, the heir to the throne, in
order to try Macduff, represents himself as being full
of vices. Macduff replies,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY MISS LESLIE.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>On</span> my first visit to Boston, about nine years since,
I was offered, by a lady of that kind and hospitable
city, (the paradise of strangers,) an introduction to
the two daughters of the celebrated Mather Byles:
and I gladly availed myself of this opportunity of
becoming acquainted with these singular women,
whom, I had been told, were classed among the
curiosities of the place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their father, a native Bostonian, (born in 1706,
during the reign of Queen Anne,) was connected
with the family of Cotton Mather. His education
was completed in England, where he studied theology
at Cambridge, and was afterwards ordained a minister
of the gospel according to the Episcopal faith.
On his return to Boston, Mather Byles was inducted
into the first pastor-ship of Hollis street church, then
a newly-erected edifice, constructed entirely of wood,
as were most American churches of that period.
He became proprietor of a house and a small piece
of ground near the junction of Tremont and Nassau
streets. In this house all his children were born,
and here the two that survived were still living.
His wife was a daughter of Governor Taylor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The position of Dr. Byles as a clergyman, his literary
acquirements, his shrewd sense, and his ready
wit, caused him to be highly popular at home, and
brought him into personal acquaintance or epistolary
correspondence with many of the principal men of
his time, on both sides of the Atlantic. He frequently
exchanged letters with Pope and with Dr. Watts:
and among the visiters at his “modest mansion”
might be enumerated some of the most distinguished
persons of his native province—while strangers of
note eagerly sought his acquaintance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All went smoothly with Dr. Byles till America
became impatient of her dependence on the crown
of Britain; and, unfortunately for him, his sympathies
were on the side of the mother country. He could
not be persuaded that her children of the new world
had sufficient cause for abrogating the authority of
the nation from whence they had sprung; and he
considered their alleged grievances as mere pretexts
for throwing off a chain which, in his opinion, had
pressed but lightly on them; and that, in short, as
Falstaff said of the Percy and Mortimer insurrection,—“Rebellion
lay in their way, and they found it.”
His congregation had warmly and almost unanimously
espoused the popular cause, and, consequently,
were much irritated at the ultra royalist feelings and
opinions of their pastor, whose difficulties with his
flock seeming daily to increase, Dr. Byles eventually
thought it best to resign his situation as minister of
Hollis street church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The war broke out; the battle of Bunker Hill was
fought, and Boston was subsequently occupied by the
British army, and besieged by the Americans, who
established themselves in hostile array upon the
heights that commanded the town,—and, with a
view of dislodging the enemy, they vigilantly exerted
themselves in stopping all supplies of fuel and provisions.
After holding out against the patriots during
a leaguer of more than eight months, the British
finally withdrew their forces, and embarked them to
carry the war into another section of the country.
Now, that something like order was again restored
in the town of Boston and its vicinity, it was thought
time to punish those who had rendered themselves
obnoxious by aiding and abetting the cause of the
enemy. Some of the most noted royalists were
expelled from the province and took refuge in Nova
Scotia, others went into voluntary exile and repaired
to England, where they preferred a claim of indemnification
for the losses they had sustained by adhering
to the cause of monarchy. Among others, Dr. Mather
Byles was denounced at a town-meeting, for his
unconcealed toryism: for having persisted in praying
for the king; and for interchanging visits with the
British officers, most of whom were received familiarly
at his house. Upon these charges he was tried
before a special court, and at first sentenced to have
his property confiscated, and himself and family transported
to England. But the board of war, out of
respect to his private character, commuted his punishment
to a short imprisonment in his own house,
under the guard of sentinels, and allowed him to
retain his possessions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rebellion eventuated in a successful revolution;
and honor, fame, and the gratitude of their
country rewarded those who had assisted in the
glorious contest for independence; while all who had
held back, and all who had sided with the enemy,
were contumeliously cast into the shade, regarded
with contempt by their former associates, or compelled
to wear out their lives in exile from the land
of their birth. Most of the connections of the Byles
family quitted the States. But the doctor remained,
and finding that he could not regain his former place
among his townsmen, he lived in retirement during
the residue of his life, and died at his own house in
Boston, in 1788, in the 82d year of his age. He was
interred beneath the pavement of the chancel in
Trinity church, having worshipped there with his
family after quitting that of Hollis street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the old family house his two surviving daughters
had ever since continued to reside, steadily refusing
to sell either the building or the lot of ground attached
to it, though liberal offers for its purchase had repeatedly
been made to them. So deep-rooted was
their attachment to this spot, where they had been
born, and where they had always lived, that they
considered it impossible for them to exist in any
other place, continually asserting that a removal
from it would certainly kill them. They had a trifling
source of income which brought them two hundred
dollars annually, and they contrived to save nearly
the whole of this little sum. Also, they possessed a
tolerable quantity of old-fashioned plate, which they
had put away in a chest up stairs, never to be used
or sold while they lived. In the mean time their
wants were chiefly supplied, (and, indeed, many little
luxuries were furnished them,) by the benevolence of
certain ladies of Boston, who, in the goodness of
their hearts, overlooked the anomaly of two women
who had the means of a comfortable independence
within their reach, submitting to receive assistance
from eleemosynary bounty rather than relinquish
the indulgence of what, in those matter-of-fact times,
would, by most persons, be regarded as a mere
morbid fancy. But on this point of feeling they
believed their happiness to depend; and their tolerant
benefactresses kindly enabled them to be happy in
their own way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Miss Byleses kept no domestic; but a man
came every morning to attend to the wood and water
part of their <span class='it'>ménage</span>, and to go their errands—and
a woman was employed every week to do up the
Saturday work. A newspaper was sent to them
gratuitously—books were lent to them, for the
youngest was something of a reader, and also wrote
verses; and they frequently received little presents
of cakes, sweetmeats, and other delicacies. They
rarely went out, except to Trinity church. Then
they put on their everlasting suits of the same Sunday
clothes: their faces being, on these occasions,
shaded with deep black veils suspended from their
bonnets, not so much for concealment as for gentility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lady who volunteered to introduce me to the
daughters of Dr. Byles, was, as I afterwards understood,
one of those who assisted in affording them
some of the comforts which they denied to themselves.
We set out on our visit on one of the loveliest
mornings of a Boston summer, the warmth of the
season being delightfully tempered by a cool breeze
from the sea. After passing the beautiful Common,
(why has it not a better name?) my companion
pointed out to me, at what seemed the termination of
the long vista of Tremont street, an old black-looking
frame-house, which, at the distance from whence I
saw it, seemed to block up the way by standing
directly across it. It was the ancient residence of
Mather Byles, and the present dwelling of his aged
daughters; one of whom was in her eighty-first and
the other in her seventy-ninth year. This part of
Tremont street, which is on the south-eastern declivity
of a hill, carried us far from all vicinity to the
aristocratic section of Boston.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length we arrived at the domain of the two
antique maidens. It was surrounded by a board
fence, which had once been a very close one, but
time and those universal depredators, “the boys,”
had made numerous cracks and chinks in it. The
house (which stood with the gable end to the street)
looked as if it had never been painted in its life. Its
exposure to the sun and rain, to the heats of a hundred
summers and the snows of a hundred winters,
had darkened its whole outside nearly to the blackness
of iron. Also, it had, even in its best days, been
evidently one of the plainest and most unbeautified
structures in the town of Boston, where many of the
old frame-houses can boast of a redolence of quaint
ornament about the doors, and windows, and porches,
and balconies. Still, there was something not unpleasant
in its aspect, or rather in its situation. It
stood at the upper end of a green lot, whose long
thick grass was enamelled with field flowers. It
was shaded with noble horse-chestnut trees relieved
against the clear blue sky, and whose close and
graceful clusters of long jagged leaves, fanned by
the light summer breeze, threw their chequered and
quivering shadows on the grass beneath, and on the
mossy roof of the venerable mansion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We entered the enclosure by a board gate, whose
only fastening was a wooden latch with a leather
string; like that which secured the wicket of Little
Red Ridinghood’s grand-mother. There was a
glimpse of female figures hastily flitting away from
a front window. We approached the house by a
narrow pathway, worn by frequent feet, in the grass,
and a few paces brought us to the front door with
its decayed and tottering wooden steps. My companion
knocked, and the door was immediately
opened by a rather broad-framed and very smiling
old lady, habited in a black worsted petticoat and a
white short-gown, into the neck of which was tucked
a book-muslin kerchief. Her silver hair was smoothly
arranged over a wrinkled but well-formed forehead,
beneath which twinkled two small blue eyes. Her
head was covered with a close full-bordered white
linen cap, that looked equally convenient for night or
for day. She welcomed us with much apparent
pleasure, and my companion introduced her to me as
Miss Mary Byles. She was the eldest of the two
sisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mary ushered us into the parlor, which was
without a carpet, and its scanty furniture seemed at
least a century old. Beneath a surprisingly high
mantel-piece was a very low fire-place, from whence
the andirons having been removed for the summer,
its only accoutrement was a marvellous thick cast-iron
back-plate, of a pattern antique even to rudeness.
There were a few straight tall-backed chairs,
some with bottoms of flag-rush, and others with
bottoms of listing; and there was one <span class='it'>fauteuil</span>, to be
described hereafter. My attention was attracted by
the oldest-looking table I had ever seen, and of so
dark a hue that it was difficult to tell whether it was
mahogany or walnut. When opened out it must
have been circular; but, now that the leaves were
let down, it exhibited a top so strangely narrow (not
more than half a foot in width) that it was impossible
to divine the object in making it so; unless, indeed,
it was the fashionable table of the time. And fashion,
at all periods, has been considered reason sufficient
for anything, however inconvenient, ugly or absurd.
To support the narrow top and the wide leaves, this
table seemed to be endowed with a hundred legs and
a proportionate number of bars crossing among them,
in every direction, all being of very elaborate
turned work. I opine that this must have been a
great table in its day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My companion inquired after the health of Miss
Catherine Byles, the youngest of the ladies. Miss
Mary replied that sister Catherine was quite unwell,
having passed a bad night with the rheumatism.
Regret was expressed at our losing the pleasure of
seeing her. But Miss Mary politely assured us that
her sister would exert herself to appear, rather than
forego an opportunity of paying her respects to the
ladies; and we as politely hoped that, on our account,
she would not put herself to the smallest inconvenience.
While compliments were thus flying, the door
of the next room opened, and Miss Catherine Byles
made her entrance, in a manner which showed us
that she went much by gracefulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Catherine was unlike her elder sister, both in
figure and face; her features being much sharper, (in
fact, excessively sharp,) and her whole person extremely
thin. She also was arrayed in a black bombasin
petticoat, a short-gown, and a close lined cap,
with a deep border that seemed almost to bury her
narrow visage. She greeted us with much cordiality,
and complained of her rheumatism with a smiling
countenance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My eyes were soon rivetted on a fine portrait of
Dr. Mather Byles, from the wonderful pencil of
Copley—wonderful in its excellence at a period
when the divine art was scarcely known in the provinces,
and when a good picture rarely found its way
to our side of the ocean. And yet, under these disadvantages,
and before he sought improvement in the
schools of Europe, did Copley achieve those extraordinary
fac-similes of the human face, that might
justly entitle him to the appellation of the Reynolds of
America, and are scarcely excelled by those of his
cotemporary, the Reynolds of England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment I looked at this picture I knew that
it <span class='it'>must</span> be a likeness; for I saw in its lineaments the
whole character of Dr. Byles, particularly the covert
humor of the eye. The face was pale, the features
well-formed, and the aspect pleasantly acute. He
was represented in his ecclesiastical habiliments,
with a curled and powdered wig. On his finger was
a signet-ring containing a very fine red cornelian.
While I was contemplating the admirably-depicted
countenance, his daughters were both very voluble
in directing my attention to the cornelian ring, which
they evidently considered the best part of the picture;
declaring it to be an exact likeness of that very
ring, and just as natural as life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before I had looked half enough at Copley’s picture,
the two old ladies directed my attention to another
portrait which they seemed to prize still more
highly. This, they informed me, was that of their
nephew, “poor boy,” whom they had not seen for
forty years. It was painted by himself.—His name
was Mather Brown, and he was the only son of
their deceased elder sister. He had removed to London,
where, as they informed me, he had <span class='it'>taken</span> the
Prince of Wales and the Duke of York—“and,
therefore,” said one of the aunts—“he is painter to
the royal family.” They both expressed much regret
that they had not been able to prevail on their father,
after the revolution, to give up America entirely, and
remove with his family to England. “In that case,”
said Miss Mary, “we should all have been introduced
at court; and the king and queen would have spoken
to us; and I dare say would have thanked us kindly
for our loyalty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The truth was, as I afterwards found, that a much
longer period than forty years had elapsed since their
nephew left America; but they always continued to
give that date to his departure. He had painted
himself with his hair reared up perpendicularly from
his forehead, powdered well, and tied behind,—and,
in a wide blue coat with yellow buttons, and a very
stiff hard-plaited shirt-frill with hand-ruffles to
match. In his hand he held an open letter, which,
both his aunts informed me, contained the very words
of an epistle sent by one of them to him, and, therefore,
was an exact likeness of that very letter. To
gratify them, I read aloud the pictured missive,
thereby proving that it really contained legible words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having looked at the pictures, I was invited by
Miss Mary Byles to take my seat in the large arm-chair,
which she assured me was a great curiosity,
being more than a hundred years old, having been
sent over from England by “government,” as a present
to their maternal grandfather, Governor Taylor.
The chair was of oak, nearly black with age, and
curiously and elaborately carved. The back was
very tall and straight, and the carving on its top terminated
in a crown. This chair was furnished with
an old velvet cushion, which was always (by way of
preservation) kept upside down, the underside being
of dark calico. Miss Mary, however, did me the
honor, as a visiter, to turn the right side up, that I
might sit upon velvet; and as soon as I had placed
myself on it, she enquired if I found it an easy seat?
On my replying in the affirmative. “I am surprised
at that”—said she, with a smile—“I wonder how
a republican can sit easy under the crown.”—Beginning
to understand my cue, I, of course, was properly
diverted with this piece of wit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Catherine then directed my attention to the
antique round table, and assured me that at this very
table Dr. Franklin had drank tea on his last visit to
Boston. Miss Mary then produced, from a closet by
the chimney-side, an ancient machine of timber and
iron in the form of a bellows, which she informed
me was two hundred years old. It looked as if it
might have been two thousand, and must have been
constructed in the very infancy of bellows-making,
about the time when people first began to grow tired
of blowing their fires with their mouths. It would
have afforded a strange contrast, and a striking illustration
of the march of intellect, if placed by the
side of one of those light and beautiful, painted, gilt
and varnished fire-improvers which abound in certain
shops in Washington street. This bellows of other
days was so heavy that it seemed to require a strong
man to work it. The handles and sides were carved
all over with remarkably cumbrous devices; and the
nozzle or spout was about the size and shape of a
very large parsnep with the point cut off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Mary now asked her sister if <span class='it'>she</span> had no
curiosities to show the ladies? Miss Catherine modestly
replied that she feared she had nothing the
ladies would care to look at. Miss Mary assured us
that sister Catherine had a box of extraordinary
things, such as were not to be seen every day, and
that they were universally considered as very great
curiosities. Miss Catherine still seemed meekly
inclined to undervalue them. My companion, who
<span class='it'>had</span> seen the things repeatedly, begged that their
Philadelphia visiter might be indulged with a view
of these rarities—and, finally, after a little more
coquetry, a sort of square band-box was produced,
and Miss Catherine did the honors of her little
museum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She showed us the envelope of a letter addressed
to her father by no less a person than Alexander
Pope, and directed in the poet’s own hand. The
writing was clear and handsome, and had evidently
been executed with a new pen, and with a desire
that the superscription should look well. Next, were
exhibited four commissions, each bearing the signature
of a different British sovereign. The names of
the royal personages were placed at the top of the
document and not at the bottom. This, the old ladies
told us was to show that royalty ought to go before
every thing else. The first signature was that of
Queen Anne, and headed the appointment of their
grandfather to the government of the province of
Massachusetts. I have never in my life seen any
autograph so bad as that of “great Anne whom three
realms obeyed”—if this was to be considered a fair
specimen. It looked as if nobody had ever taught
her to write, and had the appearance of being
scratched on the paper, not with a <span class='it'>pen</span> but with a
<span class='it'>pin</span> dipped in ink. I believe it is related of the Emperor
Charlemagne (who pressed the seals of his
missives with the hilt of his dagger) that he effected
his signature by plunging his thumb into the ink, and
making with it a large black spot or blot on the
parchment. No doubt, being a man of sense, he took
care that his dab or smear should always be of exactly
the same shape and dimension, and so <span class='it'>unique</span>
in its look as to preclude the possibility of counterfeits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next document shown us by Miss Catherine,
was honored with the name of the First George—that
sapient Elector of Hanover, whose powers of
comprehension were so obtuse that he never could
be made exactly to understand by what means he
succeeded to the throne of England, and often said
“he was afraid he was keeping some honest man
out of his place.” His majesty’s pen-maker was palpably
unworthy of holding that office, for, in this
autograph, both up strokes and down were so thick
that they looked as if done with the feather of the
quill instead of its point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afterwards was displayed a commission signed by
George the Second. Here the royal caligraphy seemed
on the mend. The signature was well written, and
his majesty’s pen-provider was evidently fit for his
station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Last, was a paper bearing the name of George the
Third, written in a fair and easy hand, but rather
inferior to that of his predecessor, notwithstanding
that the second of the Hanoverian monarchs had
“never liked <span class='it'>b</span>ainting or <span class='it'>b</span>oetry in all his life, and did
not know what good there was in either.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a most fallacious and illiberal hypothesis that
the hand-writing is characteristic of the mind. And
those who profess that theory frequently employ it
as a vehicle for the conveyance of impertinent and
unjust remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were next shown a small portion of moss
gathered from the time-honored roof of Bradgate
Hall, the mansion in which the unfortunate Lady
Jane Grey first saw the light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These relics of the departed great were followed
by the exhibition of some little articles, only remarkable
as specimens of mechanical ingenuity. Among
them was a large deep-red mulberry, looking surprisingly
like a real one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” said Miss Catherine, “I will show
you the greatest curiosity of all.” She then took out
an inner pasteboard box that had been placed within
the larger one, and setting it on the floor, produced,
from a round hole in the lid, an artificial snake, that
looked something like a very long, very close string
of button-molds. By giving it some mysterious impulse,
she set the reptile in motion, and caused it to
run about in the neighborhood of our feet. We
thought it best to be a little startled and a little
frightened, and very greatly surprised at the ingenuity
of the thing. After we had sufficiently enjoyed the
sight, Miss Catherine attempted to replace her
snake in the box, telling him it was time to go home.
But he seemed rather refractory, and quite unwilling
to re-enter his prison. “What”—said she—chastising
him with two or three smart taps—“won’t you
go in.—Are <span class='it'>you</span> a rebel too!”—The serpent stood
rebuked; and then obediently hurried back into his
hole. And we laughed as in duty bound—also with
some admiration at the old lady’s slight of hand in
managing the reptile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss <a id='cath1'></a>Catherine, having completed the exhibition of
her snake, now addressed Miss Mary, and proposed
that her sister should show us an extraordinary trick,
“which always astonished the ladies.” To this
Miss <a id='mary'></a>Mary made some objection, lest we should
have her taken up and hanged for a witch. On our
promising not to do so, she took a scrap of white
paper which she tore into four little bits, and then
laid them in a row on the table. Having done this,
she left the room, shutting the door closely after her,
so as to convince us, that while remaining outside
it was impossible for her to see or hear anything that
was done in her absence. Miss Catherine now desired
me to touch, with my finger, one of the bits of
paper—any one I pleased. I touched the second—and
Miss Mary was then called in by her sister, who
said to her, as she entered,—“Be quick.”—Miss
Mary immediately advanced to the table, and unhesitatingly
designated the second paper as that which
I touched while she was out of the room. Being
unacquainted with the trick, I was really surprised;
and wondered how she could have guessed so correctly.
The trick was several times repeated, and
every time with perfect success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After I had been thoroughly astonished, and declared
my utter inability to fathom the mystery, the
sisters explained to me its very simple process. The
four bits of paper, arranged on the table in a row,
denoted the four first letters of the alphabet.—When
I touched the second, (which signified B,) Miss
Catherine directed her sister to it by saying, as she
returned to the room—“Be quick.”—When I
touched the third—D—Miss Mary, on her entrance,
was saluted by her sister with the words—“Do you
think you can tell?”—After I had touched the first
paper, A, Miss Mary was asked—“Are you sure
you can guess?”—and when I touched C, Miss
Catherine said to Miss Mary, “Come and try once
more.” And thus, by commencing each sentence
with the letter that had just been touched, she unfailingly
pointed out to her sister the exact paper. To
succeed in this little trick, there must, of course, be
an understanding between the two persons that
exhibit it: and to most of the uninitiated it appears
very surprising. By adopting a similar plan of collusion,
some of the professors of Mesmerism have
contrived to obtain from their magnetized sleepers,
replies which, to the audience, seemed truly astonishing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We now arose to take our leave; and our attention
was then directed to a square pine table standing by
one of the windows, and covered with particularly
uninviting specimens of pincushions, needle-books,
emery-bags, &amp;c. The old ladies informed us that
this was a charity table, which they kept for the
benefit of “the poor.” I had thought that the Miss
Byleses were their own poor. However, we gratified
them by adding a trifling sum to their means of
doing good: and I became the proprietor of the
ugliest needle-book I had ever seen. But I magnanimously
left the less ugly things to tempt the choice
of those persons who really make an object of their
purchases at charity tables.—“Dear good little me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Miss Byleses were very urgent in inviting me
to repeat my visit, saying, that any time of the day
after nine o’clock, they were always ready to see
company, and would be happy to receive me and
such friends as I might wish to bring with me. And
they enumerated among their visiters, from other
parts of the Union, some highly eminent personages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While we were listening to the “more last words”
of Miss Catherine, her sister slipped out into the very
short passage that led to the house door, and then
slipped back again. We, at last, paid our parting
compliments, and Miss Mary escorted us to the front
door, but seemed to find it locked, and seemed to find
it impossible to unlock. This gave her occasion to
say wittily—“The ladies will have to send home
for their night-caps; as they are likely to be kept
here all night.” Luckily, however, this necessity
was obviated, by the key yielding as soon as it was
turned the right way: and finally Miss Mary Byles
curtsied and smiled us out.</p>

<div><h1><a id='rev'></a>REVIEW OF NEW BOOKS.</h1></div>

<hr class='tbk153'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>In</span> commencing, with the New Year, a New Volume, we
shall be permitted to say a very few words by way of <span class='it'>exordium</span>
to our usual chapter of Reviews, or, as we should
prefer calling them, of Critical Notices. Yet we speak <span class='it'>not</span>
for the sake of the <span class='it'>exordium</span>, but because we have really
something to say, and know not when or where better to
say it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the public attention, in America, has, of late days,
been more than usually directed to the matter of literary
criticism, is plainly apparent. Our periodicals are beginning
to acknowledge the importance of the science (shall
we so term it?) and to disdain the flippant <span class='it'>opinion</span> which
so long has been made its substitute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time was when we imported our critical decisions from
the mother country. For many years we enacted a perfect
farce of subserviency to the <span class='it'>dicta</span> of Great Britain. At last
a revulsion of feeling, with self-disgust, necessarily ensued.
Urged by these, we plunged into the opposite extreme. In
throwing <span class='it'>totally</span> off that “authority,” whose voice had so
long been so sacred, we even surpassed, and by much, our
original folly. But the watchword now was, “a national
literature!”—as if any true literature <span class='it'>could be</span> “national”—as
if the world at large were not the only proper stage
for the literary <span class='it'>histrio</span>. We became, suddenly, the merest
and maddest <span class='it'>partizans</span> in letters. Our papers spoke of
“tariffs” and “protection.” Our Magazines had habitual
passages about that “truly native novelist, Mr. Cooper,” or
that “staunch American genius, Mr. Paulding.” Unmindful
of the spirit of the axioms that “a prophet has <span class='it'>no</span> honor
in his own land” and that “a hero is never a hero to his
<span class='it'>valet-de-chambre</span>”—axioms founded in reason and in truth—our
reviews urged the propriety—our booksellers the
necessity, of strictly “American” themes. A foreign subject,
at this epoch, was a weight more than enough to drag
down into the very depths of critical damnation the finest
writer owning nativity in the States; while, on the reverse,
we found ourselves daily in the paradoxical dilemma of
liking, or pretending to like, a stupid book the better because
(sure enough) its stupidity was of our own growth, and discussed
our own affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, in fact, but very lately that this anomalous state of
feeling has shown any signs of subsidence. Still it <span class='it'>is</span> subsiding.
Our views of literature in general having expanded,
we begin to demand the use—to inquire into the offices and
provinces of criticism—to regard it more as an art based
immoveably in nature, less as a mere system of fluctuating
and conventional dogmas. And, with the prevalence of
these ideas, has arrived a distaste even to the home-dictation
of the bookseller-<span class='it'>coteries</span>. If our editors are not as yet
<span class='it'>all</span> independent of the will of a publisher, a majority of them
scruple, at least, <span class='it'>to confess</span> a subservience, and enter into
no positive combinations against the minority who despise
and discard it. And this is a <span class='it'>very</span> great improvement of
exceedingly late date.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Escaping these quicksands, our criticism is nevertheless
in some danger—some very little danger—of falling into
the pit of a most detestable species of cant—the cant of
<span class='it'>generality</span>. This tendency has been given it, in the first
instance, by the onward and tumultuous spirit of the age.
With the increase of the thinking-material comes the desire,
if not the necessity, of abandoning particulars for masses.
Yet in our individual case, as a nation, we seem merely to
have adopted this bias from the British Quarterly Reviews,
upon which our own Quarterlies have been slavishly and
pertinaciously modelled. In the foreign journal, the review
or criticism properly so termed, has gradually yet steadily
degenerated into what we see it at present—that is to say
into anything but criticism. Originally a “review,” was
not so called as <span class='it'>lucus a non lucendo</span>. Its name conveyed
a just idea of its design. It reviewed, or surveyed the book
whose title formed its text, and, giving an analysis of its
contents, passed judgment upon its merits or defects. But,
through the system of anonymous contribution, this natural
process lost ground from day to day. The name of a writer
being known only to a few, it became to him an object not
so much to write well, as to write fluently, at so many
guineas per sheet. The analysis of a book is a matter of
time and of mental exertion. For many classes of composition
there is required a deliberate perusal, with notes, and
subsequent generalization. An easy substitute for this
labor was found in a digest or compendium of the work
noticed, with copious extracts—or a still easier, in random
comments upon such passages as accidentally met the eye
of the critic, with the passages themselves copied at full
length. The mode of reviewing most in favor, however,
because carrying with it the greatest <span class='it'>semblance</span> of care,
was that of diffuse essay upon the subject matter of the
publication, the reviewer (?) using the facts alone which
the publication supplied, and using them as material for
some theory, the sole concern, bearing, and intention of
which, was mere difference of opinion with the author.
These came at length to be understood and habitually practised
as the customary or conventional <span class='it'>fashions</span> of review;
and although the nobler order of intellects did not fall into
the full heresy of these fashions—we may still assert
that even Macaulay’s nearest approach to criticism in its
legitimate sense, is to be found in his article upon Ranke’s
“History of the Popes”—an article in which the whole
strength of the reviewer is put forth <span class='it'>to account</span> for a single
fact—the progress of Romanism—which the book under
discussion has established.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, while we do not mean to deny that a good essay is
a good thing, we yet assert that these papers on general
topics have nothing whatever to do with that <span class='it'>criticism</span>
which their evil example has nevertheless infected <span class='it'>in se</span>.
Because these dogmatising pamphlets, which <span class='it'>were once</span>
“Reviews,” have lapsed from their original faith, it does
not follow that the faith itself is extinct—that “there shall
be no more cakes and ale”—that criticism, in its old
acceptation, does not exist. But we complain of a growing
inclination on the part of our lighter journals to believe, on
such grounds, that such is the fact—that because the British
Quarterlies, through supineness, and our own, through a
degrading imitation, have come to merge all varieties of
vague generalization in the one title of “Review,” it therefore
results that criticism, being everything in the universe,
is, consequently, nothing whatever in fact. For to this end,
and to none other conceivable, is the tendency of such propositions,
for example, as we find in a late number of that
very clever monthly magazine, Arcturus.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“But <span class='it'>now</span>” (the emphasis on the <span class='it'>now</span> is our own)—“But
<span class='it'>now</span>,” says Mr. Mathews, in the preface to the first
volume of his journal, “criticism has a wider scope and a
universal interest. It dismisses errors of grammar, and
hands over an imperfect rhyme or a false quantity to the
proof-reader; it looks <span class='it'>now</span> to the heart of the subject and
the author’s design. It is a test of opinion. Its acuteness
is not pedantic, but philosophical; it unravels the web of
the author’s mystery to interpret his meaning to others; it
detects his sophistry, because sophistry is injurious to the
heart and life; it promulgates his beauties with liberal,
generous praise, because this is its true duty as the servant
of truth. Good criticism may be well asked for, since it is
the type of the literature of the day. It gives method to
the universal inquisitiveness on every topic relating to life
or action. A criticism, <span class='it'>now</span>, includes every form of literature,
except perhaps the imaginative and the strictly dramatic.
It is an essay, a sermon, an oration, a chapter in
history, a philosophical speculation, a prose-poem, an art-novel,
a dialogue; it admits of humor, pathos, the personal
feelings of auto-biography, the broadest views of statesmanship.
As the ballad and the epic were the productions of
the days of Homer, the review is the native characteristic
growth of the nineteenth century.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We respect the talents of Mr. Mathews, but must dissent
from nearly all that he here says. The species of “review”
which he designates as the “characteristic growth of the
nineteenth century” is only the growth of the last twenty
or thirty years <span class='it'>in Great Britain</span>. The French Reviews, for
example, which are <span class='it'>not</span> anonymous, are very different
things, and preserve the <span class='it'>unique</span> spirit of true criticism. And
what need we say of the Germans?—what of Winkelmann,
of Novalis, of Schelling, of Göethe, of Augustus William,
and of Frederick Schlegel?—that their magnificent <span class='it'>critiques
raisonnées</span> differ from those of Kaimes, of Johnson,
and of Blair, in principle not at all, (for the principles of
these artists will not fail until Nature herself expires,) but
solely in their more careful elaboration, their greater thoroughness,
their more profound analysis and application of
the principles themselves. That a criticism “<span class='it'>now</span>” should
be different in spirit, as Mr. Mathews supposes, from a
criticism at any previous period, is to insinuate a charge of
variability in laws that cannot vary—the laws of man’s
heart and intellect—for these are the sole basis upon which
the true critical art is established. And this art “<span class='it'>now</span>”
no more than in the days of the “Dunciad,” can, without
neglect of its duty, “dismiss errors of grammar,” or “hand
over an imperfect rhyme or a false quantity to the proof-reader.”
What is meant by a “test of opinion” in the
connexion here given the words by Mr. M., we do not comprehend
as clearly as we could desire. By this phrase we
are as completely enveloped in doubt as was Mirabeau in
the castle of <span class='it'>If</span>. To our imperfect appreciation it seems to
form a portion of that general vagueness which is the <span class='it'>tone</span>
of the whole philosophy at this point:—but all that which
our journalist describes a criticism to be, is all that which
we sturdily maintain it <span class='it'>is not</span>. Criticism is <span class='it'>not</span>, we think,
an essay, nor a sermon, nor an oration, nor a chapter in
history, nor a philosophical speculation, nor a prose-poem,
nor an art novel, nor a dialogue. In fact, it <span class='it'>can be</span> nothing
in the world but—a criticism. But if it were all that Arcturus
imagines, it is not very clear why it might not be
equally “imaginative” or “dramatic”—a romance or a
melo-drama, or both. That it would be a farce cannot be
doubted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is against this frantic spirit of <span class='it'>generalization</span> that we
protest. We have a word, “criticism,” whose import is
sufficiently distinct, through long usage, at least; and we
have an art of high importance and clearly-ascertained
limit, which this word is quite well enough understood to
represent. Of that conglomerate science to which Mr.
Mathews so eloquently alludes, and of which we are instructed
that it is anything and everything at once—of this
science we know nothing, and really wish to know less;
but we object to our contemporary’s appropriation in its
behalf, of a term to which we, in common with a large
majority of mankind, have been accustomed to attach a
certain and very definitive idea. Is there no word but
“criticism” which may be made to serve the purposes of
“Arcturus?” Has it any objection to Orphicism, or Dialism,
or Emersonism, or any other pregnant compound indicative
of confusion worse confounded?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still, we must not pretend a total misapprehension of the
idea of Mr. Mathews, and we should be sorry that he misunderstood
<span class='it'>us</span>. It may be granted that we differ only in
terms—although the difference will yet be found not unimportant
in effect. Following the highest authority, we would
wish, in a word, to limit literary criticism to comment upon
<span class='it'>Art</span>. A book is written—and it is only <span class='it'>as the book</span> that we
subject it to review. With the opinions of the work, considered
otherwise than in their relation to the work itself,
the critic has really nothing to do. It is his part simply to
decide upon <span class='it'>the mode</span> in which these opinions are brought
to bear. Criticism is thus no “test of opinion.” For this
test, the work, divested of its pretensions as an <span class='it'>art-product</span>,
is turned over for discussion to the world at large—and
first, to that class which it especially addresses—if a history,
to the historian—if a metaphysical treatise, to the
moralist. In this, the only true and intelligible sense, it
will be seen that criticism, the test or analysis of <span class='it'>Art</span>, (<span class='it'>not</span>
of opinion,) is only properly employed upon productions
which have their basis in art itself, and although the journalist
(whose duties and objects are multiform) may turn
aside, at pleasure, from the <span class='it'>mode</span> or vehicle of opinion to
discussion of the opinion conveyed—it is still clear that he
is “<span class='it'>critical</span>” only in so much as he deviates from his true
province not at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And of the critic himself what shall we say?—for as yet
we have spoken only the <span class='it'>proem</span> to the true <span class='it'>epopea</span>. What
<span class='it'>can</span> we better say of him than, with Bulwer, that “he must
have courage to blame boldly, magnanimity to eschew envy,
genius to appreciate, learning to compare, an eye for beauty,
an ear for music, and a heart for feeling.” Let us add, a
talent for analysis and a solemn indifference to abuse.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Stanley Thorn. By Henry Cockton, Esq., Author of “Valentine
Vox, the Ventriloquist,” etc., with Numerous Illustrations,
designed by Cruikshank, Leech, etc., and engraved
by Yeager. Lea and Blanchard: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Charles O’Malley,” “Harry Lorrequer,” “Valentine
Vox,” “Stanley Thorn,” and some other effusions now “in
course of publication,” are novels depending for effect upon
what gave popularity to “Peregrine Pickle”—we mean
<span class='it'>practiced joke</span>. To men whose animal spirits are high, whatever
may be their mental ability, such works are always
acceptable. To the uneducated, to those who read little, to
the obtuse in intellect (and these three classes constitute
the mass) these books are not only acceptable, but are the
only ones which can be called so. We here make two
divisions—that of the men who <span class='it'>can</span> think but who dislike
thinking; and that of the men who either have not been
presented with the materials for thought, or who have no
brains with which to “work up” the material. With these
classes of people “Stanley Thorn” is a favorite. It not only
demands no reflection, but repels it, or dissipates it—much
as a silver rattle the wrath of a child. It is not in the least
degree <span class='it'>suggestive</span>. Its readers arise from its perusal with
the identical ideas in possession at sitting down. Yet,
<span class='it'>during</span> perusal, there has been a tingling physico-mental
exhilaration, somewhat like that induced by a cold bath, or
a flesh-brush, or a gallop on horseback—a very delightful
and very healthful matter in its way. But these things are
not <span class='it'>letters</span>. “Valentine Vox” and “Charles O’Malley” are
no more “<span class='it'>literature</span>” than cat-gut is music. The visible and
tangible tricks of a baboon belong not less to the <span class='it'>belles-lettres</span>
than does “Harry Lorrequer.” When this gentleman
adorns his countenance with lamp-black, knocks over
an apple-woman, or brings about a rent in his pantaloons, we
laugh at him when bound up in a volume, just as we would
laugh at his adventures if happening before our eyes in the
street. But mere incidents, whether serious or comic, whether
occurring or described—<span class='it'>mere incidents</span> are not books.
Neither are they the basis of books—of which the idiosyncrasy
is <span class='it'>thought</span> in contradistinction from <span class='it'>deed</span>. A book without
action cannot be; but a book is only such, to the extent of
its thought, independently of its deed. Thus of Algebra;
which is, or should be, defined as “a mode of computing with
symbols by means of signs.” With numbers, as Algebra, it
has nothing to do; and although no algebraic computation
can proceed without numbers, yet Algebra is only such to the
extent of its analysis, independently of its Arithmetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We do not mean <span class='it'>to find fault</span> with the class of performances
of which “Stanley Thorn” is one. Whatever
tends to the amusement of man tends to his benefit. Aristotle,
with singular assurance, has declared poetry the most
philosophical of all writing, (<span class='it'>spoudiotaton kai philosophikotaton
genos</span>) defending it principally upon that score. He
seems to think,—and many following him, have thought—that
the end of all literature should be instruction—a favorite
dogma of the school of Wordsworth. But it is a truism
that the end of our existence is happiness. If so, the end
of every separate aim of our existence—of every thing
connected with our existence, should be still—happiness.
Therefore, the end of instruction should be happiness—and
happiness, what is it but the extent or duration of pleasure?—therefore,
the end of instruction should be pleasure. But
the cant of the Lakists would establish the exact converse,
and make the end of all pleasure instruction. In fact, <span class='it'>ceteris
paribus</span>, he who pleases is of more importance to his fellow
man than he who instructs, since the <span class='it'>dulce</span> is alone the <span class='it'>utile</span>,
and pleasure is the end already attained, which instruction
is merely the means of attaining. It will be said that Wordsworth,
with Aristotle, has reference to instruction with eternity
in view; but either such cannot be the tendency of his
argument, or he is laboring at a sad disadvantage; for his
works—or at least those of his school—are professedly to
be understood by the few, and it is the many who stand in
need of salvation. Thus the moralist’s parade of measures
would be as completely thrown away as are those of the
devil in “Melmoth,” who plots and counterplots through
three octavo volumes for the entrapment of one or two souls,
while any common devil would have demolished one or two
thousand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, therefore, we assert that these practical-joke publications
are not “literature,” because not “thoughtful” in
any degree, we must not be understood as objecting to the
thing in itself, but to its claim upon our attention as critic.
Dr.—what is his name?—strings together a number of
facts or fancies which, when printed, answer the laudable
purpose of amusing a very large, if not a very respectable
number of people. To this proceeding upon the part of the
Doctor—or on the part of his imitator, Mr. Jeremy Stockton,
the author of “Valentine Vox,” we <span class='it'>can</span> have no objection
whatever. His <span class='it'>books</span> do not please <span class='it'>us</span>. We will not
read them. Still less shall we speak of them seriously as
<span class='it'>books</span>. Being in no respect works of art, they neither deserve,
nor are amenable to criticism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stanley Thorn” may be described, in brief, as a collection,
rather than as a series, of practical haps and mishaps,
befalling a young man very badly brought up by his
mother. He flogs his father with a codfish, and does other
similar things. We have no fault to find with him whatever
except that, in the end, he <span class='it'>does not</span> come to the gallows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have no great fault to find with <span class='it'>him</span>, but with Mr.
Bockton, his father, much. He is a consummate plagiarist;
and, in our opinion, nothing more despicable exists. There
is not a <span class='it'>good</span> incident in his book (?) of which we cannot
point out the paternity with at least a sufficient precision.
The opening adventures are all <span class='it'>in the style</span> of “Cyril Thornton.”
Bob, following Amelia in disguise, is borrowed from
one of the Smollet or Fielding novels—there are many of
our readers who will be able to say <span class='it'>which</span>. The cab driven
over the Crescent <span class='it'>trottoir</span>, is from Pierce Egan. The swindling
tricks of Colonel Somebody, at the commencement of
the novel, and of Captain Filcher afterwards, are from
“Pickwick Abroad.” The doings at Madame Pompour’s
(or some such name) with the description of Isabelle, are
from “Ecarté, or the Salons of Paris”—a <span class='it'>rich</span> book. The
Sons-of-Glory scene (or its <span class='it'>wraith</span>) we have seen—<span class='it'>somewhere</span>;
while (not to be tedious) the whole account of Stanley’s
election, from his first conception of the design, through
the entire canvass, the purchasing of the “Independents,”
the row at the hustings, the chairing, the feast, and the
petition, is so obviously <span class='it'>stolen</span> from “Ten Thousand
a-Year” as to be disgusting. Bob and the “old venerable”—what
are they but feeble reflections of young and old
Weller? The <span class='it'>tone</span> of the narration throughout is an absurd
<span class='it'>echo</span> of Boz. For example—“ ‘We’ve come agin about
them there little accounts of ourn—question is do you mean
to settle ’em or don’t you?’ His colleagues, by whom he
was backed, highly approved of this question, and winked
and nodded with the view of intimating to each other that
in their judgment that was the point.” Who so dull as to
give Mr. Bogton any more credit for these things than we
give the buffoon for the <span class='it'>rôle</span> which he has committed to
memory?</p>

<p class='pindent'>That the work will prove amusing to <span class='it'>many</span> readers, we
do not pretend to deny. The claims of Mr. Frogton, and
not of his narrative, are what we especially discuss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The edition before us is clearly printed on good paper.
The designs are by Cruikshank and Leech; and it is observable
that those of the latter are more effective in every
respect than those of the former and far more celebrated
artist.</p>

Illustrated with Numerous Engravings. With an Account
of the Author’s Life and Writings. By J. Aikin,
M. D., Author of Select Works of the British Poets. D.
Appleton and Co: New York.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This publication is one of a class which it behoves every
editor in the country to encourage, at all times, by every
good word in his power—the class, we mean of well
printed and, especially, of well illustrated works from among
the standard fictions of England. We place particular
emphasis upon the mechanical style of these reprints. The
criticism which affects to despise these adventitious aids
to the enjoyment of a work of art is at best but <span class='it'>étourderie</span>.
The illustration, to be sure, is not always in accordance
with our own understanding of the text; and this
fact, although we never hear it urged, is, perhaps, the most
reasonable objection which <span class='it'>can</span> be urged against pictorial
embellishment—for the unity of conception <span class='it'>is</span> disturbed;
but this disturbance takes place only in very slight measure
(provided the work be worth illustration at all) and its disadvantages
are far more than counterbalanced by the pleasure
(to most minds a very acute one) of comparing our
comprehension of the author’s ideas with that of the artist.
If our imagination is feeble, the design will probably be in
advance of our conception, and thus each picture will stimulate,
support, and guide the fancy. If, on the contrary,
the thought of the artist is inferior, there is the stimulus of contrast
with the excitement of triumph. Thus, in the contemplation
of a statue, or of an individual painting of merit,
the pleasure derivable from the comments of a bystander is
easily and keenly appreciable, while these comments interfere,
in no perceptible degree, with the force or the unity of
our own comprehension. We never knew a man of genius
who did not confess an interest in even the worst illustrations
of a good book—although we have known many men
of genius (who should have known better) make the confession
with reluctance, as if one which implied something
of imbecility or disgrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The present edition of one of the most admirable fictions
in the language, is, in every respect, very beautiful. The
type and paper are magnificent. The designs are very
nearly what they should be. They are sketchy, spirited
cuts, depending for effect upon the higher merits rather than
upon the minor morals of art—upon skilful grouping of
figures, vivacity, <span class='it'>naïveté</span> and originality of fancy, and
good drawing in the mass—rather than upon finish in
details, or too cautious adherence to the text. Some of the
scraps at the commencement are too diminutive to be distinct
in the style of workmanship employed, and thus have
a <span class='it'>blurred</span> appearance; but this is nearly all the fault we
can find. In general, these apparent trifles are superb;
and a great number of them are of a nature to elicit enthusiastic
praise from every true artist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Memoir by Dr. Aikin is highly interesting, and embodies
in a pleasing narrative, (with little intermixture of
criticism upon what no longer requires it,) all that is, or
need be known of Oliver Goldsmith. In the opening page
of this Memoir is an error (perhaps typographical) which,
as it <span class='it'>is</span> upon the opening page, has an awkward appearance,
and should be corrected. We allude to the word “<span class='it'>protégée</span>,”
which, in the sense, or rather with the reference
intended, should be printed <span class='it'>protégé</span>. This is a very usual
mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barring some trifling affectation, (apparent, for example,
in heading a plain English chapter with the French <span class='it'>Pensées</span>,)
this volume is very creditable to Mrs. Rives—for it
seems to be well understood that the fair author, in this
case, is the wife of the well-known Senator from Virginia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The work is modestly prefaced, and disclaims all pretension.
It is a mere re-gathering of sketches, written originally
for the amusement of friends. A lady-like taste and
delicacy (without high merit of any kind) pervade the
whole. The style is somewhat disfigured by pleonasms—or
rather, overburdened with epithets: a common fault with
enthusiastic writers who want experience in the world of
letters. For example:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“There is an <span class='it'>inexpressible</span> pleasure in gliding rapidly in
a <span class='it'>little</span> car, over the <span class='it'>neat</span> but <span class='it'>narrow turnpike</span> roads, bordered
by <span class='it'>hawthorn</span> hedges, looking out upon <span class='it'>bright</span> fields,
clothed with the <span class='it'>richest</span> and most <span class='it'>exquisite</span> verdure, occasionally
catching a glimpse of some <span class='it'>sequestered</span> cottage, with
its <span class='it'>miniature gravel</span> walks, and <span class='it'>innumerable</span> flowers, which,
at this season, in the <span class='it'>distant</span> land of the traveller, may have
bloomed and passed away, but which here offer their <span class='it'>brilliant</span>
tints, and <span class='it'>rich</span> perfume; while on the other hand some
<span class='it'>proud</span> castle rises in <span class='it'>bold</span> relief against the <span class='it'>dappled</span> sky.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Of mere errors of grammar there are more than sufficient;
and we are constrained to say that the very first sentence
of the book conveys a gross instance of faulty construction.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>“The gratification of friends must once more serve as an
apology for permitting the following souvenirs to see the

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Poetical Works of Reginald Heber, Late Bishop of Calcutta.
Lea and Blanchard: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was only a year ago that the poems of Heber were first
given to the public in a collection, from which the present
edition is a re-print; but, individually, the pieces here presented
have been long and favorably known—with the
exception of two or three lighter effusions, now first published.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The qualities of Heber are well understood. His poetry
is of a high order. He is imaginative, glowing, and vigorous,
with a skill in the management of his means unsurpassed
by that of any writer of his time, but without any
high degree of originality. Can there be anything in the
nature of a “classical” life at war with novelty <span class='it'>per se</span>? At
all events, few fine scholars, such as Heber truly was, <span class='it'>are</span>
original.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The volume before us is <span class='it'>a study</span> for the poet in the depth
and breadth of its execution. Few nobler poems were, upon
the whole, ever penned than are “Europe,” “The Passage
of the Dead Sea,” and the “Morte D’Arthur.” The minor
pieces generally are <span class='it'>very naïve</span> and beautiful. The Latin
“Carmen Seculare” would not have disgraced Horace himself.
Its versification is perfect. A sketch of the author’s
life would have well prefaced the edition, and we are sorry
to miss it.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>The Poetical Works of Lord Byron. Complete in one volume.
J. B. Lippincott and Co: Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a duodecimo of six hundred and eight pages,
including <span class='it'>all</span> the poetic works of Lord Byron. The type
is, of course, small—a fine nonpareil—but very clear and
beautiful; while the paper is of excellent quality, and the
press-work carefully done. There is a good plate engraved
by Pease from Saunders’ painting of the poet at nineteen,
and another (by the same engraver) of a design of Hucknall
Church by Westall. The binding is neat and substantial;
and the edition, on the whole, is one we can recommend.
The type is somewhat too diminutive for weak eyes—but
for readers who have no deficiency in this regard—or
as a work of reference—nothing could be better.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a literary performance it is scarcely necessary to
speak of this compilation. We make objection, however,
and pointedly, to the omission of the biographer’s name. A
sketch of the nature here inserted is worth nothing when
anonymous. Nine-tenths of the value attached to a certain
very rambling collection of Lives, depends upon our cognizance
of their having been indited by Plutarch.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Critical and Miscellaneous Essays. By Christopher North,
(Professor Wilson.) In Three Volumes. Carey and Hart:
Philadelphia.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This publication is well-timed—if, at least, there be any
truth in the report, that Professor Wilson is about to visit
this country. The reception of the man will thus be made
a part of the perusal of his works. And very glorious
works they are. No man of his age has shown greater versatility
of talent, and few, of any age, richer powers of
imagination. His literary influence has far exceeded that
of any Englishman who ever existed. His scholarship, <span class='it'>if
not profound</span>, is excursive; his criticism, <span class='it'>if not always
honest</span>, is analytical, enthusiastic, and original in manner.
His wit is vigorous, his humor great, his sarcasm bitter.
His high animal spirits give a dashing, free, hearty and
devil-may-care tone to all his compositions—a tone which
has done more towards establishing his literary popularity
and <span class='it'>dominion</span> than any single quality for which he is
remarkable. The faults of Professor Wilson, as might be
supposed from the traits of his merits, are many and great.
He is frequently led into gross injustice through personal
feeling—this is his chief sin. His tone is often <span class='it'>flippant</span>.
His scholarship is questionable as regards extent and accuracy.
His style is apt to degenerate, or rather <span class='it'>rush</span>, into a
species of bombastic <span class='it'>periphrasis</span> and <span class='it'>apostrophe</span>, of which
our own Mr. John Neal has given the best American specimens.
His analysis, although true in principle (as is
always the case with the idealist) and often profound, is
nevertheless deficient in that calm breadth and massive deliberateness
which are the features of such intellects as
that of Verülam. In short, the <span class='it'>opinions</span> of Professor Wilson
can never be safely adopted without examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The three beautiful volumes now published, will be followed
by another, embracing the more elaborate criticisms
of the author,—the celebrated critiques upon Homer, &amp;c.,
which it has not been thought expedient to include in this
collection.</p>

<p class='hang'><span class='it'>Pocahontas, and Other Poems. By Mrs. L. H. Sigourney.
Harper and Brothers: New York.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Some years ago we had occasion to speak of “Zinzendorf,
and Other Poems,” by Mrs. Sigourney, and at that
period we found, or fancied that we found many points, in
her general manner, which called for critical animadversion.
At <span class='it'>no</span> period, however, have we been so rash as to
dispute her claim to high rank among the poets of the land.
In the volume now published by the Messieurs Harper, we
are proud to discover <span class='it'>not one</span> of those more important
blemishes which were a stain upon her earlier style. We
had accused her of imitation of Mrs. Hemans—but this imitation
is no longer apparent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The author of “Pocahontas” (an unusually fine poem
of which we may take occasion to speak fully hereafter)
has also abandoned a very foolish mannerism with which
she was erewhile infected—the mannerism of heading her
pieces with paragraphs, or quotations, by way of text, from
which the poem itself ensued as a sermon. This was an
exceedingly inartistical practice, and one now well discarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lesser pieces in the volume before us have, for the
most part, already met our eye as fugitive effusions. In
general, they deserve all commendation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pocahontas” is a far finer poem than a late one on
the same subject by Mr. Seba Smith. Mrs. Sigourney,
however, has the wrong accentuation of Powhatan. In the
second stanza of the poem, too, “harassed” is in false
quantity. We speak of these trifles merely <span class='it'>en passant</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hereafter we may speak in full.</p>

Numerous Letters now first published from the Original

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Horace Walpole</span> has been well termed “the prince of
epistolary writers,” and his Letters, which in this edition
are given chronologically, form a very complete and certainly
a very <span class='it'>piquant</span> commentary on the events of his age,
as well as a record, in great part, of the most important historical
transactions from 1735 to 1797.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prefixed to the collection are the author’s “Reminiscences
of the Courts of George the First and Second”—Reminiscences
which have been styled “the very perfection
of anecdote writing.” There is, also, the “Life,” by Lord
Dover. The volumes are magnificent octavos of nearly 600
pages each, beautifully printed on excellent paper, and
handsomely bound. It is really superfluous to recommend
these books. Every man who pretends to a library will

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
